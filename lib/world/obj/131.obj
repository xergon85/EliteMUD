means for them to identify themselves to others. But they all experience

Apart from that, it is like most other aprons. White cloth with a band
up behind the neck and two strings to tie it together behind your back,
or if you are thin enough, in your front. A small pocket is also placed
in the middle of the apron front.

   Ever heard of a 'white glove test'? These gloves are the kind you use
when you really want to detect those invisible stains that annoy you and
perhaps even more your superiors so very much. They are also useful when
you do not want to place your fat fingerprints on everything you touch.
They are not worth a squat in the name of protection but they do have
their usefulness.

   The bag is air tight, at least almost. Some air seems to leak out
continuously. Perhaps one can use this to something useful, to bad it as
takes up so much space, but that is almost compensated but the nice
shimmering the cloth gives away, it almost lights up the whole room.

cabinet drawer~
   It is a big cabinet, usually filled with the least frequently used
figures for the mill. The cabinet sure looks like it could swallup up a
really good bunch of paper. The perfect dumpingplace for something that
one really do not want to see.

   The coffee cup is usually used to transport coffee from the pot to the
drinkers mouth. Sometimes it does other things, but those are always due
to some misguided staff member that does not approve of the coffee
usage, or the fact that the sugar ran out again.

nothing less. One does not need any more to know where one belong.

emblema logo~
   The mill emblema consist of two lit torches cross each other over the
crossing a sledgehammer also cross. This symbolises the fire and the
craftmanship needed to process the iron into powerful tools.
A powerful symbol, greet it with respect and a open heart.

   The pump is built up by some kind of thin blueish paper. But as there

more to it than what meets the eye. The pump is used to pump in air into

hold of it and start to pump. But wait...Was there a sound from within?
A little opening in the bottom would let you to enter it, if you wish.

   Some of the special Elite Guards of the mill use these, slabs as
shields just to tease you. The power needed to use these in combat
widely passes your abilities. You can try, but the result would be more
