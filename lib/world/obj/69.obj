optimizer~
It is a very unpredictable piece of software, consisting mostly of
self-modifying code and inexcusable goto commands.  Looks very dangerous.
[note - this is not an item for mortals, hence the high rent (assuming you
have a rentable version) and high strength min]

blade~
The Olympian blade is a stunning work of craftsmanship, obviously
made by Hephaistos, the Blacksmith god.  This powerful, one-of-a-kind
weapon is almost too good to be in the hands of a mere mortal.  
Perhaps it would be wise to return it to the appropriate deity.

coffee machine~
It is a big old-fashioned thing that most of all resembles a cupboard with a
slot large enough to hold three coffee cups at once.  It doesn't appear to
have any buttons or any other means of control.  Golden letters on its front
tell that this is a Quifatronic C-1000 mk I.
