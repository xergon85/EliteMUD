knife butter~
Since ancient times that daggers are part of a Knight's equipment. A 
special dagger was designed by Lord Vader to honor the most brave in 
combat. The craft used to manufacture this device is unique, the cold 
steel is forged in fire and ice with the blood of its owner. High 
Knights from Fields of Anarchy who have proven themselves in combat 
usually proudly display this unique craft. It has been known for its 
ultra sharp double edged blade which ends in a dark ebony handle 
carved with the words:

                   "Honor, loyalty and commitment". 

Because of its sharpness it is known has "the butter knife".
