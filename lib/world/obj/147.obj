As an extremely secret, extremely evil society, Glob Inc has tentacles
that have threaded their way into the hearts of societies around the
world. New members are given this medallion or some other piece of body
wear bearing the Glob insignia. They are told that it is a gift and a
means for them to identify themselves to others. But they all experience
the feeling of being watched as well, for ever and ever afterwards.

box blue sizzling~
The box is very heavy for its size. Clear blue, as your find suitable as
there are small blue streaks going between two metal pegs on top of the
box. There is also a little marker next to the pegs saying 'That Way'.~

blue dragon scales~
Someone have gone a lot of trouble sawing all these clear blue scales
together. Collecting them would have a rather dangerous job too as not to
many dragons let people gather them. The shield feels a bit heavy but on
the other hand it delivers quite a bit of protection.~

blue dragon scale~
The scales form a rather uncomfortable protection as there is no soft
leather on the inside which is common practice for heavier armor, but if
you are in a hurry and up against a dragon, those things are rather
minor.

bob evil grin~
Bobs face is not a very nice sight, but preserved in the correct way it
can be used to scare the calmest people. But then only the most evil of
evil would even think the idea of strapping on someone else's face.~

These fair leather boots are so very soft that you almost cannot feel the
ground below. A good guess would be that if you want to make the maximum
distance between you and your opponents this is the right tool.

This ring seems to be the membership sign of some odd group of people.
Hidden away out in the darkest corner of the forest they grow silently in
power and one day they just might let you come to visit, one last time...

wet dress~
Lifting the soaking cloth up in the air you see that it is a dress.
Trying to squeeze the water out of it you notice very quickly that it
just keep coming more and more. Now why would Ma Glob(the previous owner)
walk around in dress that never would dry up ? Guess it's a bit to late
to ask.

If you press water out of the dress it is drinkable at your own risk.~

The umbrella seems to be in suitable size for the tiniest of fairy
children or perhaps for a humanized mouse. It has got sharp ends which
you find rather uncomfortable for a umbrella. But then again who knows
what turn fairies on...

The huge single crystal fountain stands firmly in front of you. It looks
very inviting to just reach in and take one of the glasses standing on
small protrusions on the fountain. Candles also fill up the small
cavities of the ever steaming fountain of refreshment.

The chef suit is astonishingly white and without stains. Either the
