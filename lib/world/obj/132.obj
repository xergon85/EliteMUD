Pump fountain water clear~
   The metal pump is securely fixed into the mountain via a strong
fundament and some bolts. A lever allows clear mineral water to be pumped
up from some distant water reservoir below. A little problematic it still
seems as a constant rattling of air bubbles seems to appear when pumping.
Perhaps it is some punishment for something Fritz did before or maybe it
is just bad plumbing.

   A tentacle of an octopus has been cut off in a piece the size
of one suction pod. The pod still sticks to anything, anywhere or anyone
it is pressed against, giving the piece a rather strange way of staying
in place. The octopus flesh have received no treatment and the muscle
fibres hang out from the uneven cut. This surely must be an object that
will start to smell horribly after a while.

   The bottle is made of glass and could surely be brittle, but it is a
rather common and accepted way of storing smaller amounts of liquid,
dispite this. The glassblowers were really fussy when it came to the
apperance, so there is a lot of strange carvings and pictures on it.
