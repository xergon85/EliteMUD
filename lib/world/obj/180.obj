spider spiderweb web sleeves~
The cloth for these sleeves was woven by the queen spider in gratitude
to a mage who protected her while she was busy laying her thousands of
eggs.  The tailor who stitched the sleeves found the cloth difficult to
cut and sew, but the result was a remarkable pair of sleeves that are
extremely strong, very magical, and very beautiful.

It is said this ancient sword has been passed down from archmage to
archmage since first created deep in the mists of time.  It was forged
for the fabled Merlin, magician to King Arthur.  It is a small sword,
with a curved blade that owes its sharpness to magic rather than the
grindstone.

softer shades.  The blouse is loosely gathered at the neck and wrists,
