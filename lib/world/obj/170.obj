E
book guide~
It's a leather bound book with gold trim. When you flip it open, you see the
following instructions:

1. Show newbies where the Halls of Learning is (tell 'em free eq)

      Much of the contents of this book is covered in the Halls, but some is
   new text.

2. Give them directions to some newbie zones, and tell them about the
   'help midgaard' command.

3. Explain the really cool things of Elite, like speed walk, extra great, 
   aliases, colour, and everything else that makes our mud truly Elite. 

      For aliases, they are string replacement's and are really cool, but they
   can screw up the other commands if good names are not chosen.
      To fix the screen, 'display norm', 'display ansi', 'display vt', 
   resize <screen length>, and redraw are things that could help. The "]" 
   character they might see are from the colour mode.

E
2~
                                  - 2 -

4. Explain the rules, such as no rent, the 100 item limit, and 'policy.'

     It's not a bad idea to have them read the policy then and ask questions.
   Tell them to read the boards often explain about each (mortal, social...)
   Explain about communications (grat, gossip, tell, shout ...) and what each
   is for.
     Explain to them what an Immortal is and that they are here to help them in 
   times of problems.  If they are having a problem, they can put the problem 
   in their title.
     Stationery shop and mudmail are cool too, but only if they seem really 
   patient.

5. If needed, explain how to equip themselves, such as wear <item>, hold <item>
   wield <item>, and how to fight ('consider' is a really good command).

6. Explain look <direction>, scrolls, guilds, hunger, thirst, 'sac corpse', 
   'get all corpse' and whatever else a total newbie needs to know.

                                  - 3 -

7. The main purpose of mud is social interaction. You get to meet and talk to
   from all around the globe, and in no other game can you do that. On the
   other hand, it is rather boring to play if all you want to do is go kill
   stuff. There is no sound, no pictures, it is all just plain text...and text
   that lags a lot too *sigh*. We do not want Elite to be a hack and slash
   type of mud. We stride to make it as user friendly (as logically) possible.
   If they are just stats seekers, encourage them to go play some other home
   computer game, where they can maybe even see the monsters in full motion
   3-D and stereo sound.

8. Casting spells, giving money, giving equipment, corpse retreival and 
   divulging stats is NOT ALLOWED. Once they are not newbies, you CANNOT tell
   them what is a good area to go to, or what is a good thing to wear. If 
   players need it, tell them to get it from other players. Naughty immortals 
   WILL face the wraith of a 12 gauge shotgun! Or worse...

9. Most importantly, Elite prides itself on being a user-friendly social mud.
   Please be patient and curteous to all newbies, no matter how silly their
   questions may seem. Keep in mind that not everyone is as good (or bad) in
   English as you are. There are people from literally around the globe at 
   Elite, from Canada to Russia to Canada to Portugal and even some obscure
   places like the US. Remember, you were once a total newbie too...and maybe
   you still are (dunno).
