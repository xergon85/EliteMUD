could end up taking you anywhere. With that in mind you decide it 
would be wisest NOT to enter this one.

shield cracked~
Some kind of detonation has put a huge split in this magnificent shield. 
It still seems strong enough to offer you some protection. It bears a 
holy insignia, perhaps its previous owner was a religious warrior?

kebab burnt charred~
The kebab is burnt to a crisp and the meat is of questionable origin. 
It doesn't look particularly appetising, but once you've had a few 
drinks there will be no more delicious sight in the universe.

chainmail chain melted~
Finely crafted in silver and bronze, this chainmail was clearly once 
meant for a rich lord. However, exposure to a great heat has melted 
the links together, which will make it difficult to manoeuvre in.

vorpal blade~
It glitters like jewels in the sun, and is so narrow that it vanishes 
when viewed edge-on. You touch the blade experimentally and your hand 
passes right through it. Testing it on a piece of wood however reveals 
that while it will not harm you, it will severely damage anything you 
use it on!
