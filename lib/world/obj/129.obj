excrement fresh handful~
Yuk! How horrible. Why would anyone would want to even pick this up - 
never mind carry it around with them!? I dont want to describe it, but
you did ask (freak) so here goes. It is dark brown in colour, with 
perhaps a hint of brackish green. About the length of your hand and
slightly squishy to the touch. Oh and it stinks (and now you do too - 
much worse than a troll)

crown pixie~
The little pixie crown is tiny and beautiful - although meant for the
head of a pixie, it is about the right size to wear about the wrist. 
The tiny crown is woven from strands of bluebells and snowdrops, set 
with rose petals (which glitter like magical jewels), and held together
with spidersilk.

wings pixie~
The tiny wings are so thin as to be almost completely transparent. Two
tiny folds on the underside would allow the wings to be used as a 
shield, although they are so flimsy, it would not offer much protection. 
Still, maybe the residual pixie magic will have some beneficial effect.

The bog boots are specially designed for use in swampy environments. At 
a glance, they appear to be fairly normal (if muddy) boots. But on 
closer inspection, the soles are attached to wide mesh platforms, to 
spread the wearers weight over a wider area, and prevent them from 
sinking.
