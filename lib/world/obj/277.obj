This #GShrubbery#N seems like it burns forever. It is an inspiration 
to any #RKnight #Ywho say #GNI!#N. If you come across member 101, make 
sure your #GShrubbery#N is safe because he lost his own. He is 
completely mad about others #GShrubberies#N.

There is a paper attached to this device. It reads the following:
Armaments, chapter two, versus nine to twenty-one.

"And Saint Atila raised the hand grenade up high,
saying, 'Oh, Lord, bless this thy hand grenade that with it thou
mayest blow thy enemies to tiny bits, in thy mercy.' And the Lord
did grin, and people did feast upon the lambs, and sloths, and carp, 
and anchovies, and orangutans, and breakfast cereals, and fruits bats,
and large ..."

"And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin.
Then, shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the
number thou count, and the number of the counting shalt be three.
Four shalt thou not count, nor either count thou two, excepting that
thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once the number three,
being the third number, be reached, then lobbest thou thy Holy Hand
Grenade of Antioch towards thou foe, who being naughty in my sight,
shall snuff it.'"

Amen.
