stopper which is attached to the body of the bota by a short cord.
This particular bota is made of dragon skin, which is particularly
thick and has insulating properties much needed by the dragons while
they are alive.  This skin shimmers with rainbow colors.

Dragons breed and raise their young in deep underground caves.  They
live in large clans headed by a female and her group of male consorts.
Many eggs are laid and kept protected in the dragon hatchery.  When
they hatch, the young are soft, fuzzy pale colors, and they are unable
to fly, breathe fire or do any of the very nasty tricks that older
dragons learn.  For this, they must go to dragon school, run by the
dragon master.

As they grow older, the rapidly enlarging dragons shed their skin many
times.  With each molt their color grows deeper and richer  until they
finally achieve the jewel tones so favored by adult dragons.

Dragons are known to gather and hoard the treasures of the earth -
precious and semi-precious jewels, gold and silver.  The adventurer
finding the grand dragon's jewels would truly be wealthy for life.

Dragons are a happy group, by and large, with a very strong sense of
humor.  When they swoop down upon a defenseless village and burn it to
the ground they do so not from any evil purpose, but just from the
sheer joy of it.

Some dragon has chosen to leave a precious egg here.  Dragon eggs 
come in many hues, but all are deep, rich, jewel tones.  Although
they take a long time to hatch, there is no way to tell (from the
outside) how soon this egg will crack.  Of course, the fact that it
seems to be rocking itself might give you a clue that whatever is 
inside is pretty big!

medallion eye~
An extremely secret, extremely evil society, Glob Inc has tentacles that
have threaded their way into the heart of societies around the world.
New members are given this medallion or some other piece of body wear
bearing the Glob insignia.  They are told that it is a gift and a means
for them to identify themselves to others.  But they all experience a
feeling of being watched, ever afterwards.

Little is known about this society.  Perhaps it is best not to know too
much.
