wedding ring drusian vow~
 Ever since I was young, I've dreamt of a future that I always wanted to 
have. Every night I would look up at the stars and make a wish and blow a 
kiss that one day happiness would be mine. In all my dreams and all my 
hopes, I never thought I  would find a love like this. You've filled my 
life and my heart with such happiness and such love that mere words would 
never do it justice. You are my life. You are my world. You are my 
happiness. It seems as though I've loved you forever. In a way I guess I 
have. It's because of you I now smile freely and have a joy in my heart 
I've never known. Thank you for making me a better person but mostly thank 
you for loving me. This is our life now and we will walk through it 
together. We can get through anything as long as we stand together and we 
will. I love you - always. - Charlene

wedding ring bod vow~
 When you came into my life, I was scared and frightened and the path 
seemed empty for me. I never expected to fall in love with you but when I 
opened my eyes and realised I did it was a most beautiful feeling and 
something I now wonder how I ever lived without. You opened my eyes and my 
heart to a world I never knew. It is because of you life is worth living. 
Everyday is special because of you. It is because of you that I smile and 
feel peace in my heart. On this day onto forever, I promise to love and 
cherish and care for you. I will always stand with you and will always be 
there. Happiness is our world now. Happiness together. This our future. 
bright, strong and full of love. Thank you for loving me. Thank you for 
you. I love you - forever.  - Tim
