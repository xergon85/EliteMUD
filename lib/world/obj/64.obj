*STOMP* is the last sound most small harmless creatures hear
when Stanley's Stompin' Boots come crushing down on them. These boots
are really really big and heavy to fit Stanley's bloated feet.
Stanley likes to *stomp* away on small creatures (the big ones
can strike back, so that isnt any fun) when he gets irritated,
which is quite often.

helmet dwarven mining~
As every dwarf knows, "them rockies hurt!", especially when they hit you on
the head. To prevent this, every dwarven miner has to wear this helmet,
protecting them from the small pebbles that falls from the cavern roof. It
does not, however, protect them from the more heavy rocks. (or maces, clubs,
hammers and other tools of violence).

gold ring~
This golden ring represents very fine work of the dwarves.  On it you see
engraved the emblem of King Kwathoum, the current Dwarf King. Kwathoum gave it
to Gwandolyn when they married, long dwarfyears ago.

gloves~
These gloves are made from yak hide tanned and beaten soft as a baby human's
skin.  They are tough enough to withstand the constant use by the miners, and
protect the dwarves' skin.

Perhaps if you took this to a metallurgist, he might tell you if it was
actually worth anything.  Or perhaps you could simply try to sell it.

mark~
Dwarf miners worship Mostal, and depend upon him to protect him from the
many very real dangers of life beneath the crust of the earth.  He is seen in
Dwarven art (what there is of it) as dark as the earth itself, with a beard
full and thick, eyes of deepest blue, and a thick, short body.  His mark
resembles one of the gifts of the earth, a lump of coal.
