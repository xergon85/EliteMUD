They seem to come in an infinite variety of colors and flavors, but all
are extremely sweet.

leggings of elvenkind~
Thick leather leggings made for elven rangers must provide adequate
protection against the fierce predators that lurk in the forest, yet
not restrict a ranger's movements.  Rangers may need to climb trees,
race through underbrush, or perform other feats requiring great
agility.  These leggings were made with all of that in mind.

silver snake armband ssnake silver~
Out of the corner of your eye, you see a forked tongue slither 
quickly out of the snake's mouth.  The sapphire eye glitters.  Of
dwarven origin and craftmanship, you think, for the engraving and
delicate workmanship of this silver snake is very lifelike.

wedding ring Flyns~
A wide band of white gold has been thickly covered with tiny oval gems
of every hue and color.  Each gleams, joyfully reflecting any ambient
light. On the inside of the band, a faint engraving reads "I love you" and even more faintly, "Flyn & Jellie - Valentine's Day" and what looks like it must have been a year but is too worn to read.

The wood for the Master Ranger's Great Hunting Bow was given to his
ancestor by a grateful forest at the time of the first dragon invasion
countless millenia ago. Modern rangers added mithril-tipped arrows
dipped in a poison know only to members of their craft.

Why is it that the stuff that's good for you always has to taste so
bad?  This is undoubtedly good for you, but feels really evil goin'
