star shuriken~
This beautifully crafted star has been passed down through generations
of Shogun. It was created by the Grandmasters of the Koga Ninja for
the use of only the most honourable Shogun. Aquiring this great artifact
is one of the greatest signs of respect that a Shogun can be shown. The
star itself is made from a strange metal. It appears to be gold, and
is no doubt priceless, but the metal is much stronger and cannot be
bent or dented. Perhaps there is a great magic at work here. Around the
centre of the star, circling the small hole, used for carrying it, there
is an #rengraving#N. It seems to be in ancient pictograms, but a Shogun
master should be able to decipher it.
