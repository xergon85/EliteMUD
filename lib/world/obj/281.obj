This strong man is often called Big Guy. His job is to stop people 
from sneaking into the chamber where the council have important 
meetings. For a second you think that you could trick him and quietly 
sneak in through the door, you drop that thought very quickly when 
Big Guy stares at you with rage in his eyes.

greedy midget~
This short and fat little fellow is wearing a black hood that is at 
least one size too big for him. Smiley hired him for guarding The 
Library and that means that he have to stay here for the rest if his 
life. Watching people sleep and change equipment is not the most fun 
thing you can do so the midget got bored pretty fast. Don't feel sorry 
for him, this job pays well.

fountain~
#BDarklord#N's fountain is heated by the very core of the world
in which we live. The heated blood fades into the cracks on the floor in
which you are now standing. Carved into this intricate fountain are the
succubi and the wretched of whom the great man himself hath slain.
An inscription upon the lip of the only portion cleansed catches your eye.
You will be my next victim!

statue darklord~
A complete replica of Darklord, this statue poses as much a threat
as the actual person. With his long black cape, sparkling staff, and
the face of absolute evil, this crystallized statue reminds us of the
greatest magician, the most deviant, and the wisest leader that ever
roamed this realm.

necklace defiance tkkclan~
You can see your face reflected in the silver metal.
This must be what gives the Kultists their strength to fight
for what they believe in. No matter if it comes to defending
a clannie or boasting in general. #CT#CK#wK#N does it all the way.
On the inside of the necklace you can see how the owner has 
carved the following words:

                #CT#ch#wrill #CK#ci#wll #CK#cu#wlt Forever

Over the years of #CT#ch#we #CK#cu#wlts#N life many have vanished to
the next realm, all of them pouring their strength, wisdom and
power into this one entity. Shining bright with the power of
#CT#ch#we #CK#cu#wlt#N, this artifact lives forever as do all our souls.
