pen silver key~
No matter how you try you can't seem to get this pen to write, you 
guess it must be tuned somehow so that only Malaig can use it.  Another 
strange thing - it has a square cross section, making it awkward to 
hold.

The tiny dragon tries to attack you, but he's only two inches high and is
unable to harm you in the slightest.  He breathes flame in a vain 
attempt to burn you to ash, lighting up the entire room. Hmm...wait a 
minute...that gives you an idea...
