hat~
Granny Higglebottom in Stanneg knits these special caps for the gnomish
yakherders from fine, soft wool.  It has a little added "something" from
the magic of her hands.  The colors she has used are many different
shades of grasses found on the yak plateau, and because of this the yaks
are very attracted to the wearer of the hat.  It is a long, narrow tube,
tapering to a point at one end.
