The altar is made from a single block of dark marble. Swirling veins 
of grey, white and red in the heavily polished stone give the altar 
the appearence of a raging storm. Around the rear of the altar is a 
deep recess, which glows with magical energy. There is an inscription 
at the back of the recess, etched into the stone.

stormbringer sdclan artefact~
The Stormbringer is a legendary weapon in which is captured the infinite
might of the DragonLords of Old. It is an enormous spiked mace, made of
a reddish crystalline material and glowing from within with dragonfire. A
deep groaning ROOOOOAAAAAAAAAR escapes the Stormbringer as it moves
through the air, and when it strikes an enemy there is a detonation, like
a thunderclap!

The making of a Stormbringer is incredibly difficult, and requires 
centuries of Dragon Lore, as well as a mastery over dragonkind and some 
rare items of a magical nature. Although the art was lost for centuries, 
the current rulers of the Storm Dragons have rediscovered it, and the
world will tremble anew under the furious pounding of the Stormbringer!
