handbook hand book newbie~
Welcome to EliteMUD. You have chosen to embark upon a great adventure
and this guide has been written to help you get started. In order to
make this Mud an enjoyable place for everybody, we ask that you read 
and obey our simple rules - these can be viewed by typing POLICY. This
guide should contain enough information to get you started, but if
there is anything you do not understand, typing "help <topic>" should 
explain things to you. If you discover errors in the help files, or 
there are topics missing, contact an immortal (level 110+) and they 
will assist you.

This handbook contains information on a number of topics. Typing 
"read <topic>" will list the information you require. Here is the list:

Introduction
Getting Started
Finding Equipment
Gaining Levels
Clans
~
E
Introduction~
EliteMUD is a MUD unlike any other. Based on CircleMUD code, and running
originally from Sweden, Elitemud was started in 1994 by IO and Rigel. The 
game has run continuously since then, and passed through the hands of
several implementors. The game currently runs from a site in America.

There are 109 mortal levels, and a remort system that allows multiclassing
up to 4th remort. Characters above level 109 are immortals, and are there
to help make everyones EliteMUD experience more enjoyable. If you need
immortal help, type "who 110-" to see a list of online immortals. You can
see a list of all immortals by typing "wizlist". Their particular 
responsibilities are listed in "immlist".

All new players are automatically enrolled into the Adventurers Guild
clan. This allows new players to get to know each other and help each
other learn their way around. In addition, there are several Guildmasters
who will help you when you are stuck. The Adventurers Guild is not
a real clan, and you may resign and apply to a real clan anytime after
level 10. See the later section on Clans.

There is a dedicated communication channel for new players. Type 
"newbie <your message>" and usually people will try to help you.

Help may also be found on several webpages. Currently, the EliteMUD official
webpage is at #Ghttp://orangeroad.tzo.com/~elitemud#N. 

~
E
getting started~
EliteMUD has 18 mortal races, and 17 classes to choose from. (Although 
some races are available as quest rewards only.) All of the classes 
practice at one of the standard four guilds: Warrior, Thief, Cleric, 
and Mage. The Guilds are marked on the map of Midgaard which can be 
viewed at any time by typing "help midgaard".

At any time until level 10 you can type "recall" to return to the temple. 
After level 10, you will have to purchase recall scrolls, or walk back 
to the temple.

Inside your guild, you can use practice sessions to improve your 
skills and spells. To see a list of the things you can learn, and to
see how many practice sessions you have left type "practice" when
standing next to your guildmaster. The different skills and spells should
be explained in the help files. Enter "help <skill>" to check what a
skill does.

If you are new to mudding, you should visit the Halls of Learning, which
are located west, west, north from the recall point.
~
E
finding equipment~
There are four places in Midgaard where good equipment may be found.
The donation room (east from temple), the Adventurers Guild donation 
room (west, up, west), the Armory (two south, west, south), and the 
Weaponsmith (two south, two east, north from temple).

At any shop, you can type "list" to see what items are on offer, their
minimum level, and the cost. When you start out, you will not have very
much money, so the best places to start are probably the donation rooms.
Although items in donation rooms have been freely given, it is considered
impolite to take items you do not need, and shopkeepers will not permit 
you to sell items you have obtained from a donation room.

Equipment may also be aquired by killing mobiles (mobs) and taking any
items from their corpse. You may also find gold this way. In addition, 
you will receive gold as a reward from the gods if you sacrifice mob
corpses (type "help sacrifice"). The quickest way to make gold is to kill
mobs for their equipment and sell it in the shops. If on the other hand
you prefer to help others you may donate items using the "donate" command, 
which will usually transfer the item to the Midgaard donation room.

E
equipment2~
Good equipment makes levelling much easier. Every item of equipment that
you can wear, will have an effect on your statistics. Typing "stats" will
give you a listing of your current status. There are several values which
are worth noting.

Hitroll affects how likely you are to hit a mob. The higher your hitroll
the more often you will strike your enemies.

Damroll is a value added to your normal weapon damage when you strike a
mob. The higher the damroll, the harder you hit.

Thac0 stands for "To Hit Armour Class 0" and tells the mud how good you
are at hitting armoured mobs. Your thac0 depends on your level and 
your class and is not changed by any equipment you can wear.

AC or armour class is a measure of how well protected you are. It starts
from 100 and becomes lower with better equipment. A well equipped starting
character can manage an armour class of around 0-10. A well equipped 
high level character might have an armour class of around -350 and for a
fourth remort, an armour class of better than -550 is not uncommon.

Weapons: You can use two weapons at a time. Wield one, and then hold
the second. You will receive the bonuses from holding the second weapon.
Some low level weapons can be enchanted, which gives them +2HR and +2DR.
Make sure both your weapons are enchanted when you start. 
~
E
gaining levels~
You can gain levels on EliteMUD by killing mobiles (mobs). When you type
"score" you can see how much more experience you need to reach your next
level. 

Level advancement is automatic, once you have surpassed the experience
requirement. WHen you level, you will gain additional hit points, mana
and movement points, and occasionally your Thac0 and statistics (strength,
constitution etc.) will increase.

When starting out, try killing animals in the Newbie Zoo, which is sseeeees
from the temple. Other good places for new players to go are the catacombs
(down from the temple) and the north road (north from the temple). Typing
"help areas" will show you the area help files for EliteMUD - if you cannot
find zones by exploring, ask other players and they will help you find your
way around.
~
E
clans~
The Clan system on EliteMUD allows groups of mudders with similar outlooks
to come together and socialize - and help each other out. All new players
start in a special clan called the Adventurers Guild. This allows players
to become familiar with the workings of clans, meet other new people and
make new friends. However, once you reach level 25 you will be ejected
from the clan and will be forced to choose either to remain clanless, or
join one of the other clans.

Typing "clan" on its own will show you a list of available clan commands - 
experiment with them to find out what they do!

You can resign from Adventurers Guild and apply to another clan at any time
after level 10. To see a list of other clans type "clan info".
