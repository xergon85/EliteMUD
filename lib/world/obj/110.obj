The large swing is painted white to match the picket fence that
surrounds the small house.  It looks quite cozy, and would probably
make a great place to sit down and relax.

This tasty morsel looks good enough to eat!  Better get it fast
before the Kookaburra snatches it up.

brick~
This large brick was once part of the magnificent bridge.  However,
due to terrible maintenance, the bridge is falling apart.  The brick
looks quite heavy, and you probably won't be able to pick it up.

This meatball is making your mouth water.  If it wasn't for the bits
of dust that it has aquired from being on the floor, it'd be
absolutely perfect!

shoe~
The shoe is covered with mud, and it looks quite alone without its
mate.  A small silver buckle covers the top half of the shoe, and the
leather tongue seems to be sticking out right at you!  You better not
try to take the shoe, it looks quite stuck to the ground.
