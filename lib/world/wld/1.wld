#NThe Garden of #RV#ra#wlhal#rl#Ra#N~
     As you enter this area, the power overwhelms you.  You are surrounded
by many trees and bushes.  This appears to be some kind of mystical 
garden.  You notice something strange though.  This garden is like none
you have ever seen.  All of the foliage seems to be strategically placed.
There also appears to be a substance in puddles on the ground resembling
blood.  Upon further examination you come to the realization that this,
while in appearance a garden, is really a battlefield for those who
inhabit Valhalla.

Entrance to Valhalla~
     You stand in front of a majestic palace.  The walls emanate
power and glory.  You also have the feeling that you are being watched
with every move.  The size of the palace is overwhelming and seems to
reach into the heavens.  There is a large wooden door in front of you that
has the width of 800 men standing side by side.  You notice a large oak
tree and upon examining its upper reaches, you notice a strange little
structure that resembles a treehouse.

Mithrandir \the clan Valhalla itself.
Marene     who will probably never read this since she doesn't mud, but my
           best friend and the one who gave me the idea of Valhalla for a
           clan.
Valhalla   showed their support and faith in me in getting the clan
Clannies   formed.

    I wanted to show my deepest appreciation towards these people.
Without any of them, Valhalla would still be just an image in my mind.
These are the people who truly formed Valhalla.
Thank you all for your help and support,
Bruce

You notice the statue you are looking at is really Thor, the god of
thunder.  He is wearing a pair of magic iron gloves and, wielded in one
hand, is a red hot magic hammer.  Around his waist is a magic belt which
emanates strength.  All, gifts from Dvalin, the dwarf chieftan.

Hall of the Slain~
     You stand in the entrance hallway to Valhalla.  The walls are
made of gold and upon closer inspection, the roof is formed from battle
shields.  Huge spears seem to be the main supports which hold up the
ceiling.  The room is extremely well-lit, but you notice no lights.  You
realize since the spears are so highly polished, the gleam from them is
the only source of light needed.

all of the conferences are held among the members of the clan.  The other

wounds after battle.  Numerous Valkyries tend to the injured with food,
drink, and basic medical council.  The forces in this room seem to be
greater than the others, for health and strength return in mere moments
to the wounded.

     As you enter this room a shiver runs down your spine.  You have
entered a cold, dimly lit room.  In front of you rests a large, closed
coffin with a candle burning at each end.  The walls of the room are a
dark grey and there is a red carpet under the coffin.  As you turn to
leave this frightening room, you feel two little spikes penetrate your
neck.  You realize that the inhabitant of the coffin truly was home.  As
you start to fade into darkness, your last thoughts are... "I wonder how

     You have entered a room in which the first words that come to your
mouth are, "What a mess!"  A huge waterbed takes up the far end wall.
Along one of the walls is an enormous trophy case containing all of the
rewards of battle and all of the trophies and plaques received over the
years in various sports (mainly baseball).  Various pieces of equipment
are set up in order for Bruce to finely tune his skills in the martial
arts.  A bookshelf along the other wall contains three complete
collections.  Those of Stephen King, Calvin and Hobbes, and Bloom County.
A guitar and tenor saxophone lay in the corner of the room, while in
another corner sounds of Led Zeppelin, Dave Matthews, Dog's Eye View,
Wallflowers, and many others can be heard.

not too much to this room.  Momar is a pretty basic guy.  There is a large
picture of Turtle on the east wall, with a burning fireplace underneath
it.  Other than the Smiths playing in the background, the room is pretty
quiet.  The keys to his '97 vette are laying on the table just ahead of

     As you enter this spacious abode, the smell of burning incense
overcomes you.  The room is very dark, with candles glowing all around,
and black lights on the ceiling, giving a florescent glow to the posters
on the wall.  In the center of the room, there are two computers set up,
one next to the other, obviously where Smilex and Aria sit and play with
the internet.  There is a speaker in each of the four corners, and the
music of Boyz II Men is playing softly.  The entertainment center is
placed so that it can be operated and viewed from while sitting at the
computers.  On one of the screens the words "I love Madison" are moving
slowly across, and on the other it reads "I love Smilex".  There is a
futon in front of the entertainment center, to sit on while watching TV,
and if you listen quietly, you can hear the squeaking of a mouse.  Perhaps
this is Roger, Smilex's pet.  The walls seem to glow, making you think you
are protected.

catches your eye.  There is some magnificent equipment carelessly left
there.  As you approach the equipment, you feel somthing pull at your

he cuts the rope and you land rather roughly, head first.  Welcome.

large, comfortable, black leather seat, and a big fluffy mattress lies in
the opposite corner.  A special rack for weaponry and armor is installed
in the wall.  Some extremely rare artifacts have received a place of honor
there.  There is an immense bookcase beside it, filled with books of
literally ALL kinds and sizes.  The window provides an awesome view of
the Gardens of Valhalla, and far in the distance you recognize the Great
Field of Midgaard.  Some poppies are flourishing on the window-sill.  A
massive oaken table, surrounded by six heavy chairs and with a huge
silvery candlestand on it stands in the middle of the room.  There is a
fireplace in the wall, and above it hangs a small metal plaque.  Two

around you. At a first glance you see a few #Cponcho#N type packs
hanging on the wall. You are starting to wonder what this place is.
You watch as red beams of light are shooting from every possible
direction. You then know this place must belong to Link the Laser Quest
freak. You decide not to put a pack on because you probably will only be
staying for a few minutes.  As you look more thoroughly through the room
you can see a weapon rack that has about 4 swords on it, one of them being
the all mighty #CMaster Sword#N. You see a pile of paper, most likely
#Cscore cards#N.  You then see a stairway leading up into a swirling

There are some tables and chairs here also.  A bartender is standing

"The booze is free".  As you take a beer and sit down on a chair, you see

#RThe Black Hall#N~
     You stand in the middle of a large, round chamber, vaulted high with
black stone supports.  The chamber is crafted from polished black marble,
glittering with the dim light that emanates from torches, spaced about the
room at even intervals.  Platinum inlays line the chamber's vaulted
ceilings. In the middle of the chamber, there sits a large, ebony desk
littered with papers and various magical items. The north wall has upon it
a large, picture window from which can be seen a beautiful view of
Midgaard and the Elite world.

#RThe Secret Meeting Room#N~
     In this room of white and black marble, the clan's most powerful
leaders meet to decide how to do the world more ruin. A black marble table
lies in the middle of the room and around its sides are thrones of white
marble. On each of the thrones is etched a symbol of the twisted lord or
lady the throne is for. At one end of the table lie two thrones of white
rock with red streaks running through them. At the far end of the table is
a throne on a dias made of solid obsidian.

Dungeon of Drineas~
  You feel a sudden chill when you enter this dark room. The only light
comes from a few torches hanging on the walls. Somewhere in the distance,
yet very close, you can hear whispering prayers and chants. Along one wall
you see three pieces of armor and clothing. The first one is a magnificent
armour, forged in the blackest of steel but enchanted to a minimum of
weight.  The next one is a set of priest robes. Black and red, they have
the words "Redemption" sown onto the sleeves, a flame tounge sown onto its
chest.  The last set is a pair of ordinary clothes, made of the finest
quality yet nothing marks them out.  A small bookshelf is standing against
the opposite wall, holding books on all subjects that may be of any
interest
to Drineas. A charred skeleton hangs from the wall with its hands attached
to
a pair of shackles, and next to it a beautiful sculpture in black marble
of
a fair drow lady. On the other side of the room there is a large desk
close
to the wall, with a comfortable chair behind it. Several items are on the
desk, a small candle provides the light that is needed, a large tomb is
lying
open and a few scrolls is laying next to a quill pen. On the wall behind
the
desk a large flag is hanging. The background represents two crossed
torches,
with a hooded and grinning skull overlapping them.

darkness stretches in all directions.  It seems you can see a bed and
other furniture in the distance, but as you approach, two snarling hell
hounds leap up from their chained posts and begin to howl, straining to  
get at you.  Panicked, you turn to exit, but there is no door! All the
lies before you is more inky darkness and death approaches...

A thousand years ago, supersition and the sword ruled.  It was a time of 
darkness it was the age of gargolyes.  Stone by day warriors by night.  
As a gargoyle  I have sworn to protect my clan.  I am the defender of the 
TRI Clan. I am Demona the Gargoyle.
 
 
Insences fills the room reminding you of a far off land.  Silken sashes hang 
from the ceiling making it hard to judge the size of the room.  Eerie melodies
waft across the air.  You feel a peace, a oneness with yourself and the world 
around.  You have entered a calm state.  Thoughts of the world of mobs and 
levels fade like a distant stome. A voice speaks out and says, 'Come, relax, 
and enjoy all I can offer.  One request, please check your egos at the door.

Ogy's Room~
  You have entered the room of one of the TRI clan leaders, the honorable
and humble Ogy. The room is filled with a wide variety of art and artifact
depicting the areas of skill and knowledge, that Ogy has chosen to gain
power, honor, and glory, in the name of the mightiest of all the clans,
the TRI clan.
  Against the east wall you see a large and luxurious waterbed, so large
in fact, you could lay two people end to end and still not span the length
or width of this masterpiece of aquatic hybernation. On the wall above the
bed is a large portrait of Ogy in battle against the nearly indestructable
"ferocious killer rabbit".
  On west wall can be seen a large rack holding a vast arsenal of weapons.
It contains practically every type of weapon imaginable. You shiver at the
thought that any one person could be their master.
  Near the west wall is large cabinet. Peering within you see a enormous
assortment of healing and recupritive items. Seen are, scrolls, potions,
vials, herbs, and several other items you've never seen before.  It is quite
clear that Ogy is not just a run of the mill healer, but is instead well
versed in the healing arts.
  A bookcase stands against the entire north wall. It contains volume after
volume of magical knowledge from times long forgotten upto the present day.
Mastering the knowledge contained in just a few of these precious tabloids
would most certainly make any man one of the most powerful magic-users in
the land.  Your mind reels to think of the person who could master them all.

     You are in a small clearing in what seem to be a endless forest.
Strange, you think as you are sure that this is within the walls of
the TRI-clanhouse. But considering it is the home of Egba Glob, you
are not really surprised. The climate in here is very moist and you
feel really refreshed. In the centre of the clearing is a small statue
of some very odd deity. It is surrounded by large heaps of gold and
jewellery, weapons, bloodstenched armours and one or two dismembered
peasants. This surely is : the Home of Egba Glob the Furry Deep One.

Hath's Lair~
    What is this!? - You wonder as you step inside his lair. The room
that from the outside looked so warm and cozy has turned into an icy
and dark lair as you step over the threshold. Gloom and sadness is
lurking here in the shadows, making you feel uncomfortable.
It's cold here, so very cold. A chilly wind is blowing from nowhere.
A large bed is placed in the middle of the lair. Above the bed there
is circular window in the roof, from there you can see the dark
starlit sky and the Northern lights dancing seductively.
In the middle of the bed you can see an old torn teddy-bear. You
smile a bit as you see it. Everyone, no matter how strong, needs some
comfort and support when times are tough.
     On one of the Icy walls you can see a carving of a red dragon on 
a snowcovered mountain top. There are a Sun and a Moon on each side of 
the mountain, facing each other. From the dragon's nostrils and mouth,
a cone of cold can be seen as it breaths. It is probably the first time
you've seen a red dragon breathe something other than fire. The carving
looks very much alive and you can almost feel the serpent eyes watch you
as you move along. Strange indeed.
     Then on the floor under the bed you can see a half-written book about
the clan called TRI. "Hath's guide to TRI" it's called. You open it and read
the first lines in the introduction.

"This is the book written by me, Hath. I am a TRI in heart and will always
be no matter what. Of me you can ask the way of a true TRI, beginner as
a master, lawful or chaotic. Everyone is welcome.
Here the story begins..."

   Thin ledges extend across large pools of lava, winding their way
through a large black stone tunnel.  At the far end of the tunnel a
large shrine rises upward from the rolling waves of molten metal.
Pillars extend hundreds of feet into the air, reaching to the
cavern ceiling, and decorated by smaller carvings of skulls and
winged demons.  The inner hall lays out before you some several hundred
yards lined with paintings, carvings, and tapestries depicting demons
and gods such as Uk-tya'nuka, Marduk, and Lucifer.  Mammoth giant
demons in black and crimson armor guard the various halls the branch
off from the main hall.  In the center of the hall, a large golden
alter, stained in blood , rests before a Hideous throne of black metal,
bone, and pure dark power.  Banners on either side of the throne depict
ancient runes detailing the dark lord Milamber, and his master,
the Angel of Chaos.

There is a soft breeze coming from the balcony, where Mystic can often

one of her lovely Goddess and sister, Brigantia... and one of the WHOLE

     Awe is what you feel, standing in front of these truely gigantic
gates, which burn perpetually, keeping those not of Phos from entering our
sacred refuge.  The burning spires tower high above you, seeming to singe
the clouds and reach for the sun in their marvelous granduer.  Amazingly,
the spectacular gates are only the beginning of the wonders that await you
when you enter our sacred fold.

#MDen of the Eclipse#N~
     The first thing that catches your eye as you enter this immense
dining room for the followers of Phos is a monstrous marble dining table.
Each of our esteemed brothers and sisters claims a seat, where we discuss
our exploits and drink wine until Phos shines upon us once again.  Richly
dark oak pillars stand around the table, and huge fires remind us of our
Lord when he is away blessing others.  A #Ygolden plaque#N hangs on the
eastern wall.  Thick rugs and furs invite you to remove your heavy boots
and sit for a spell, and talk amongst yourselves.

#MPhos' High Altar#N~
     This dedication to our god, Phos, is an immense room with a dome
made of stained glass.  The entire room is golden with the light of our
beloved Lord of the Sun.  Even at night, the room still emenates a warm
glow, a gift given to his chosen ones by our benevolent Lord.  The walls
glitter with elaborate tapestries of silk, glittering weapons, and gilded
icons showing our faith.  A very warm feeling of replenishment flows
through your veins as you stand here, for the light from above invigorates
your weary body.  Rest here and Phos will watch over you.

#MBurning Den#N~
     Warmth encompasses your body as you enter the den.  A hearth heats
the entire room, and fire pits lie spitting and hissing in the four
corners of the room.  Two enormous couches sit facing each other, large
enough to accomodate all the Dragoons and then some.  A thick slab of
redwood serves as a table and a footrest, and engraved mugs of pewter lie
scattered and empty.  While the dining room serves the more serious and
formal matters, this room is designed purely for comfort.  This is also
where the Dragoons hone their battle skills, so as not forget the reason
they banded together.  They will always remain exceptional warriors.

the chaos and turmoil of the world around it.  Animals from all around
drink from the stream here and there is a feeling of innocence in the air

comes from a nearby waterfall which sparkles when the sun reflects through
it.  The beauty of this place overwhelms you.  Then you see the reason
this place has managed to survive the world it is in; a majestic unicorn
steps out of the woods with muscles rippling in fluid motion, it's spire

Maybe now, such titles as Deimos's "Silver Dragon" or Sinner

Maybe names such as Ji and Elvis, Dikuman and Funnyguy won't be forgotten...
Thank you, Djeli, for allowing me to write the clan history.. I think
since Evil's deletion I'm probably the one who knows it best, although
of late my view has been from the outside and not from within.
Congratulations, Storm Dragons, you have a clan you should all be
proud of. You did something I, and others, failed to do.

You made a clan out of yourselves, and for that, I respect you.

to the mortal world and became the first mortal to remort thrice, making
him one of Midgaard's mightiest heroes. He seized the clan, and led it to
new heights
new blood joined, and working with old gods, made the clan
something fresh, something new. 
Storm Dragons today are indeed a popular clan, ranging between 4 or 5 and
15 people online, truly impressive. They are a clan with a history like
no other, for few have a history so rich, or so controversial. The clan is
a clan of firsts... the first 3rd remort, and the first clan to use unique
clan titles.. also the reason why only advisors and higher can resign from
a clan. Due to the Storm Dragons, 2 clans died, GeNeX, and Shadow Runners, and
many others spent themselves attempting to extinguish this clan. Clan wars 
almost became a reality.

Shampoo became the clan Mother Goddess and Lagg remained the sole Grand Drake.

STORM DRAGON CLAN HISTORY (New Hope)
Storm Dragons, as a clan, drifted. It was no longer a potent clan, and its
most prominent warriors became gods, leaving a vaccuum of talent in the
world of Midgaard. It was a clan with no leader, and existed in a void,
with no goals, and no identify. Those who had attempted to save it had
left it for dead.. but it did not die.
Salvation came in the guise of Avalon and Zharradan. Avalon became more
and more mighty as an immortal, while Zharradan, an absent god, returned

forever. In one fell swoop, myself, Sinner, Deimos, Elvis, and Hoffa left
the clan, and the Storm Dragons lurched on the edge of death.
For a short time I stayed in the Holy Unicorns, while others drifted into
clanlessness or the Shadowblades of old. After immorting, I spoke with 
friends, Deimos, Sinner, Radagast and Puck, and the 5 of us returned with
renewed spirit to attempt to save our clan.
It was not to be so. New policies drove friends away, old leaders lost hope,
and Santa faded away. In anger and despair some of the Storm Dragons' finest
left, off to search for what they sought to create. Shadowblade accepted many,
while others formed new clans: the Army of Darkness, and Saracen, later
to be known as Kai. Still others drifted to the Holy Unicorns and the Pack.

and more people ignored the clan line. What was once a clan was now merely
a collection of people.
It was at this time that several Storm Dragons left the clan and formed
what became known as the SHOGUN clan.

STORM DRAGON CLAN HISTORY (Clan War)

No, clan war never happened, but it nearly did. Hatred came from everywhere,
and old allies, such as the SHOGUNS, soon turned on their old friends. Rotting
from within, warring from without, the Storm Dragons slowly lost hope. Evil
became aloof, and I, in my attempts to save the clan, nearly destroyed it

For some reason, Anubis was raised to the rank of Grand Drake, and this began
a tendency to raise people to the ruler rank. This resulted in a bit of 
chaos until a balance was reached with first 3 rulers, and later 5, with
Santa being the first among equals and me being the Queen over all. 
Sinner, Radagast, Anubis, Deimos, Sinner, Puck, Gurk, Santa, Reddragon, and
I believe Odie, all served in the post of Grand Drake at one point or another.
Lagg was the last of them, until the recent election.
Slowly, the clan deteriorated, as apathy took hold and people began to ignore
their kin. A slow rotting became an explosion, and the problems became deeper
and deeper. The very thing that made the clan grow began to destroy it,
and the recruitment policy of the leaders began to show its evils as more

The Storm Dragons grew swiftly, with a recruitment policy more aggresive
than any other in the history of elite. Only a few clans became as despised
as the Storm Dragons were. Clumsiness on the part of myself and apathy on
the part of Santa only quickened the problem, and soon the Storm Dragons had
to look into themselves to see what had gone wrong.

STORM DRAGON CLAN HISTORY (The Turmoil)
I was the first Mother Goddess, as Djeli's title was known back then, 
and Reddragon was the first Grand Drake, or clan ruler. As I earlier said,
I pursuaded Evil that Santa was more suited to this role. Avalon was the
first and only Overgod, but Evil was the first Celestial Emperor.

STORM DRAGON CLAN HISTORY (The Beginning)
Long ago, a great assassin known as Evil achieved his immortality
indeed,
his swiftness in becoming a god was only matched, rather ironically, by
Zharradan. He found a place for himself in the clan of the Shadowblades,
and soon was reckoned as a mighty warrior, in guises of Santa and Reddragon,
the powerful dragon lords.
The dragon Reddragon contrived to found a clan, a people in his new world, 
and with the elf Nymph as queen and the assassin Evil as Celestial Emperor,
the Storm Dragons formed.
Exodus began. Evil was a popular deity and Santa a respected hero, and many
of his comrades from the Shadowblades followed, many disenchanted with the
loss of Telcor. I managed to convinved Santa to take charge over Reddragon,
and soon this infamous ancient dragon Lord was master of the Storm Dragon
clan.

Kamthra's Sanctum of Solitude~
An ancient stone table cluttered with heavy tomes of knowledge, strange
artifacts and all manner of arcane devices, stands proudly in the centre of
this oversize chamber. One side of the table is left slightly clear, and here
rests a mysterious pulsating globe held in the clenched talons of a bronze
stand, slowly changing colour as you watch. On one side of the room, a old
weathered wooden bookcase strains under the weight of a mountain of books.
Huge crystal windows span a whole side of the room, extending upwards to meet
high above you in a dome. A large threadbare divan rests in a corner of the
room, and a roaring fire blazes in the fireplace,  strangely without the need
of any fuel. Above the fireplace hangs a great oil-painting and the most
noticeable fixture is the ornate full length mirror bordered with softly
glowing mystic symbols, which stands in front of a stone wall.

another, the relentless sea crashes against cold grey rocks. A break in the

Outside the #N#CT#ch#wrill #N#CK#ci#wll #N#CK#cu#wlt#N~
     You are standing outside a stone structure looking in, how sad.  Do you
think you have what it takes to get past the animated stone monk of the Kult?
If you belong here you have no fears otherwise.  Well step forward and see.
Don't worry you can only die once.  On the other hand how slowly you die is
completely up to us.  You note that most women are permitted to exit and
enter, but one can only guess if it is at their leisure.

all around you see prizes won in battle, like the broken #Cspear#N of the
Avatar and the shattered pitch #Cfork#N of Satan, won when the clan went
hunting in Hell.  You also see the skins and skulls of many monsters slain
in the hunt.  Tiamat is here stuffed like a teddy #Cbear#N, she doesn't
look so tough now does she?

after great deeds and weaves new diabolical plans.  Tombs of great kings

gathered from vast regions of the world and places that do not exist in

     You have entered the private home of Muse and Warpath.  The dark-red
walls are lined with pictures of them.  The decoration is completed with
the trophy heads of their opponents.  Seeing some rather well-known and
powerful peoples' heads displayed makes you pray that you never will be
unfortunate enough to join those ranks.  Plush carpets cover the floor,
and the bed occupying the center of the room is surrounded by throw
pillows to lounge on.  A fire is blazing in the fireplace, keeping you
warm.  In a corner you also catch a glimpse of a huge golden chest with
several locks on it.  You wonder what treasures it might be filled with.
You should feel very special to have been invited here by Muse and
Warpath, as they don't trust many people enough to let them into this
room.  You see 2 doors in the room, one leading out into the clanhouse,

it looks very inviting with the red satin sheets covering it.  You also
see what looks like a shrine in the opposite corner, dimly lit, and
seemingly used for some sort of dark and vapiric magic.  The aura of the

entered it, as you are not sure if you will leave it again, at least not

God of Storms, Zeus. Plush red carpets cover the floors, and statues of some
of #bElysiums#N' lost and fallen clansmen line the walls. A broad, plush red
carpeted stairway curves gracefully up either side of the hall, leading to
the personal rooms on the upper floors. Beautifully crafted mahogany double

entrance, to the south, is formed by two enormous intricately carved

There is a light layer of fog over the ground, giving the area a foreboding
feeling. You notice that some of the shrubbery is formed into the semblance
of comfortable looking furniture. Directly opposite the door is a large
altar to Gaea, the Mother Earth, whom NightWolf worships above all others.
This place has a strong calming effect on all who come here, as if the very
trees themselves ensure the peace. Many small woodland #Ycreatures#N wander
in and out of the clearing, as well as the occasional stag. Things can be
heard moving in the trees beyond sight, and every once in awhile a pair of
softly glowing red or gold eyes can be seen looking out into the clearing
and then away. A large pitch black #Bwolf#N sits and silently watches the
clearing from between two trees, implying that leaving this clearing any way
other than the way you came in is an extremely bad idea.

is a very detailed life size carving of a radiantly beautiful young woman.

This is the most beautiful carving you've ever seen. The wood is
polished smooth as glass, and the wood is burned in just the right places to
give the carving a life of it's own. The woman is simply striking. Her dark
hair falls gently down over her shoulders and her eyes star intently back at
you. Her body is beautifully proportioned, softly curving back to become one
with the tree. You can do nothing but stand in awe of the sheer beauty of
this woman. It must have taken many many long months of work to create such

This is the largest wolf you've ever seen. As he sits there calmly

spreads across this wolves face whenever he looks at NightWolf. While he
remains gentle and calm, you feel that this wolf would have no problem
dispatching a Hell Hound. And you know he's not alone.

Small squirrels, ferrets, and Fuzzy Bunnies, as well as numerous

stools.  In each corner is a large ivory #cpillar#N, with the
#cvisage#N of Darquon carved into each one, facing into the center of
the room.  As you walk across the marble tiles, you are greeted by the
wail of a jazz band, which seems to originate from nowhere.  Across
from the couch are a couple easy chairs made out of red suede and a
glass coffee table, upon which sits a crumpled leisure suit and
sunglasses.  On the other side of the room is a large king-sized futon
mattress, which is set on an elevated portion of the floor, next to
which stands a large marble hot tub, bubbling over with hot steam and
suds.  On the edge of the tub is a small framed #cpicture#N of an
attractive young woman.  The only thing that seems to be missing is
the hazy shade of cigarette #csmoke#N.  Yes, this is truly the
decadent room of a demon-turned-avatar.

   As you walk into this, seemingly small, room you are amazed by its actual

and tidy, excepting the strewn about computer hardware, disks, and CDs, and
the frightening number of wires creating some sort of networked abomination
of the occupants computers. You feel the deep desire to rent a room in this
wonderful place, or at least hangout with us for awhile.

An Archway~
     You are standing in front of the Divine Powers Clan House.  Before
you stands a large, golden arch, emitting a glow around the entrance of
the house.  A transparent object of some kind is floating above the arch,
and although you cannot make out its shape, it has a halo around it.
Perhaps this is symbolic of the members of the clan, are they so powerful
that they glow?  You cannot see much beyond the doorway, for the house
is greatly protected by the gods above.

he's working on.  You believe the room to be fairly drab, but since the
only light comes from the computer moniter you can't quite say for sure.
A small mini fridge sits in the corner, and a few half full bags of chips
are lying about the floor.  You wonder how anyone could ever live in this

none other than the most beautiful thing you have ever set your eyes on.
As you walk closer, you pass through a curtain of spaghetti that you had
not noticed before. On the other side of the curtain, you almost burst a
kidney from laughing so hard.  The spaghetti apparently warped your
vision, as the throne turned out to be nothing but the enormous stove
where Wolfman sits as the King Of Noodles.  Maybe if you are lucky, you
will catch a glimpse of him at the stove, making a meal fit for the gods.

You have arrived in what appears to be Zifnab's private chambers.  The
room is decorated by ancient stone walls with two large windows allowing
sunlight to illuminate the room.  Through the windows you can make out the
Great Field of Midgaard and Haon-Dor forest off in the distance.
The room contains several furnishings.  An ornately carved wooden desk
lies along the western wall below one of the windows illuminating the room.
On the desk lies a large opened book with a candle on each side of it.  A
large bed lies along the northern wall with a large chest at the foot of
it. An aura seems to emanate from the chest suggesting that contained
inside are many treasures that Zifnab has amassed in his journeys.  On
the walls are several paintings depicting different events in Zifnab's
life and of the many friends that he has met in his stay here.
A large set of oak double doors lies to the south leading into a
hallway in the castle.
