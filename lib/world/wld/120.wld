A marble statue of a young man in his prime, Jason bears navigational
instruments in one hand.  His attention is very focused, and you suppose
he must be concentrated on the dragon he soon will face.  He is
surrounded by statues in niches set along the sides of the hallway.
Each niche contains a statue to one of his companions on the voyage.
You can see Hercules, Castor, Pollux, Orpheus and Theseus.

sewers, but the sewers are vast in size and have many turns and twists,
foiling the light that would illuminate them.  If you failed to bring a
