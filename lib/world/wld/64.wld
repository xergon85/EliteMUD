The Path To The Dwarven Village~
   A long narrow path slopes along in the foothills that lead to the
huge ore rich mountains of the dwarven kingdom.  To the north (up and
down several hills) lies a big purple mountain where the dwarven miners
live and work.  To the south and west lies fertile land farmed by
halfling and gnome farmers.

Wandering through Meadows~
    A narrow path wanders through rolling meadows that, in spring and
summer are filled with colorful flowers.  The land appears very fertile.
Neat hedgerows and stiles mark boundaries between different fields.
There is no sign of habitation, however, just the unending path leading
east around a small pond and south through more hills.  A small cart
track heads west.

   On a narrow path between neatly arranged, neatly bordered fields, the

the sparse forest equidistant to the south.  The farmland surrounding
the path is almost too peaceful.  The path heads north to the mountains,

Nearing the Dwarf Mountains~
   Although not their official name, the deep purple mountains to the
north are known as the Dwarf Mountains since the Dwarven Kingdom lies
within their boundaries.  There is nothing remotely dwarfish about them,
however, and the path rises steeply in that direction, through
increasingly rocky foothills.  To the south it wanders over softly
rolling hills through well-ordered farmland.

covered with forest so thick and dark there are no low bushes or scrub.

no footprints to be seen, although the occasional animal dropping

inside a mountain.  The tunnel is only about 4' (a bit over a meter)
high, a comfortable height for a dwarf, but too small for many who would
try to steal their treasures!  The tunnel walls are covered with a heavy
layer of soot and grime which soaks up the torchlight..  The tunnel

   Here the floor of the cave is hard and smooth beneath your feet, and
the tunnel is quite wide.  Standing in the center of the path, lifting
both arms, you cannot touch either side or the roof of the cave.  From

the marvellous creation should stop working.  The gnomes were, sadly,
kept underground until they perished from lack of sunlight.  Their

Hanging in a basket over a chasm~
   The basket is swaying considerably, mostly due to the fact that you
are or were walking around in it and only a little part due to the fact
that a terrible storm roars just a few feet away from you. It seems that
the basket is protected in some kind of safe pocket. You are still not
over so keep on walking or the wind just might get closer...

 Darkness should not be gleaming. There is definitely something wrong
with this place. That depth needs to be further investigated but where
can one descend safely? Not here for sure. Maybe a long ladder would
help...

Standing in a basket inside a wooden house~
   Ah, The house is a start on a ropeway over the chasm.
The powerful ropes that go over the chasm will, probably, take you over
safe. But you have to work for it. Incorporated in the bottom of the
basket you are standing in is a treadmill. Walk in the opposite
direction you came and the basket will take you over the chasm.
Neat and simple.  The door has closed behind you so you better
start walking.

Back in a house at the chasm edge~

Well now you have two options:   Either jump 'ashore' or start walking
on another trip. You have paid for unlimited travel as long as you
ticket lasts so why not take another spin?

A house at a chasm~
   You are standing next to a house on the very edge of a huge chasm. It
looks really shabby but it stands, even though two strong ropes seem to
drag it into the open mountain. Around the house is a little grassy
field stuffed in between the huge mountains. A small path trails of east
through the grass.

   You have reached a little field in the mountains, but it does not
look as harmonious as one could think or hope. The grass has some
greyish stuff on it that stains your feet when you touch it and on one
of the sides of the field a huge chasm opens up apparently tearing a
house apart.  A little path leads up into the mountains and west to the
house.

The Start of the Old Trail up the Mountains~
   You are standing at the base of the Moria mountains. A half cleared
trail leads up the mountains to the north. To the south a trail leads
back to Midgaard. Far to the west you can see the river flowing into the
mountain and to the east you see the large forest of Namir. A large sign
has been placed on a pole here.

The Hidden Room~
   In a small, dark space lit only by a cheery magical fire, a troop of
gnomes swap tales in a storytelling contest.  The smokeless fire has
burned the same logs for many long years, and the outside world seems
far away.  There is a magical quality about this room, and it seems easy
to forget that there IS a world outside this one.

contest storytelling gnomes lost~
Many years ago, the group left their yak farm on the plateau to help
their friends the dwarves.  Iron ore production was down, and the gnomes
relied on the fine plow-heads made by the dwarves, so there was a bit of
self-interest as well.  Once the gnomes had created and installed a
system of pulleys to help harvest the ore, they retreated to this small
cottage for a story-telling competition, the prize to be possession of
an enormous jar of cookies.  They have been here ever since.  No gnome
can resist the lure of a good story.
