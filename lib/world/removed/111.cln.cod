     We are searchers, forever looking for the uncomfortable truth of
our human condition, searching within ourselves for that which is
unclean, uncertain or impure -for that which has no name. By looking
at the monsters we create, we gain new insight into our "darker 
half." These fiends express what we are at the deepest and most 
inaccessible levels of our unconscious. Since time immemorial, they 
have given us a connection to our animal self, the fulfillment of an 
unadulterated emotional vitality, and the promise of a brutal 
justice.
     The vampire is the quintessential fiend, for the vampire is so
much our own reflection. Vampires feed as we feed, by killing, and
through death can feel the same dread, guilt and longing for
escape. They are trapped in the same cycle of fast, feast and
purge. They, like us, seek redemption, purity and peace. The vampire
is the poetic expression of our deepest fears, and the shadow of our
most primal urges.
     Just as the hero of legend must descend into the pit of 
Purgatory to face the tormentor, overcome personal weaknesses, and 
finally be cleansed in order to return home with the gift of fire, so 
must we descend into the depths of our own soul and return to life 
with the secrets we have won.  That is the real journey of 
Prometheus. It is the meaning of the myth.  Only by embarking on such 
a journey can we discover our true selves and look into the mirror.
     The lure of this promise of spiritual connection is well-nigh
irresistible. But, in the end, it is a most disturbing undertaking.
You must take head and step carefully - for no journey is ever 
without its perils.  Do not look into your own soul, unless you are 
willing to confront that which you find there.
     So remember:
                    There are no such thing as monsters....

     To become a child of darkness you must be minimuim level of 30 
and apply.  Then talk to a member of the rank Justicar or higher. 
You'll then be given a one week trial membership in the clan. If all 
goes well, you will become a member.
