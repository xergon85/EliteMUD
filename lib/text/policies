Please be aware that being abusive will get you nowhere and you 
may be left in jail to cool down.

All of these rules have room for interpretation.  

The Immortal(s) on-line will make an initial ruling.  

If for some reason you do not think that your judgment was fair, 
seek a level 113+ Immortal. They will make the final ruling if  
they decide the original ruling was VERY unfair or biased.

The listed penalties are only guidelines, but should be adhered to.
