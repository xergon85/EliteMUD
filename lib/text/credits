        EliteMUD 6.3 is being developed from EliteMUD 6.0 by Bod and Djmcave

        EliteMUD 6.0 was developed from EliteMUD 5.0 by Petya Vachranukunkiet

	EliteMud 5.0 was developed from CircleMUD 2.2 by Petrus Wang and
	Richard Rosenberg (although I have become rather lazy
	so Petrus is the real power behind the mud...)
	at the Royal Institute of Technology (RIT).
	CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" 
	Elson at Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.

	Law.

	Many people are helping us with this mud and in time they will have
	their rightful place here.
