Dismal   (Nov  6) [14378] i quited and logged on anew again to fix the bug.. but well, the group bugs need to be fixed (dismal)
Dismal   (Nov  6) [24068] what i bleieve must be fixed about the grouping bug is that all links, inlcuding protection must be cleared when ungroup, or stopped follow (dismal)
