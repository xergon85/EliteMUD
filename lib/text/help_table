! ^

Use ! to repeat the last command typed at the keyboard.

Use ^ to replace a string from the last command with a new string.  The
syntax is the same as in csh: "^old-string^replacement"  For example:

> tell rasmusse Hi there, how are you?
No-one by that name here.

> ^rasmusse^rasmussen
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you?'

> ^you^you doing^
You tell Rasmussen, 'Hi there, how are you doing?'

2-MULTI-CLASS MULTI

One class isn't enough for some so they try to get the most out of two.
#
3-MULTI-CLASS MULTI

Trying to master 3 classes isn't easy.  But when it is done there isn't 
much you can't do.
#
AC

"AC" is your armor class.  It is a number from -10 to 10, roughly
defined as follows:

  10 Naked person
   0 Badly armored
 -10 Average armored.
 -20 Good armored
 -30 Well armored
 -40 Strongly armored
 -50 For almost all mobs impossible to hit
 -60 Armored battle tank :)

The score command displays your armor class as a number such as 78/10;
this means 78 on a scale from 100 down (i.e., 7.8 on the 10-scale)

"ADVANCED MARTIAL ARTS" 

As a ninja progresses and masters Ninjitsu, they learn a multitude of 
deadly kicks, punches, and strikes. Each technique is learned and then 
applicable to the Ninjitsu they already know bestowing bonuses in damage

"ANIMATE DEAD"
Usage          : cast 'animate dead' corpse : cast 54 corpse
Effect         : Raises a corpse to life
Cost           : 150 Mn
Duration       : Instant

When cast, this spell will raise a corpse to life as an undead
servant of the caster.
#
ANSI COLOR

If you have a color-capable terminal and wish to see useful color-coding
of information, use the COLOR command to set the level of coloring you 
see.

> color off
This command disables all color.

> color sparse
> color normal
> color complete

These three commands turn color on to various levels.  Experiment to see
which level suits your personal taste.

Using color will slow down the speed at which you see messages VERY 
slightly.  The effect is more noticable on slower connections.  Even if 
you have color turned on, non-colorized messages will not be slowed down 
at all.

ARENA WARGAMES WARGAME JOIN SHOOT

   The Arena is the home of the Wargames. To play a game, just type 
"wargame" to see the current game's status, if any, and if there isn't 
one running, type "wargame start". You'll notice you have other options, 
as well, namely, teams, ammo, and hits.  These are all pretty much self 
explanatory. Simply type "wargame ammo #" to change the amount of 
ammunition a player has, "wargame hits #" to change the amount of hits a 
player can sustain before being eliminated, and "wargame teams #" for 
however many teams you might like. (0 is the default, and should be used 
for a free-for-all type game) When a game begins, type "join" and you 
will be transported to the Arena. Once all the players have joined, the 
gamesmaster should type "wargame run". Once the game begins, an exit will 
appear. You may shoot your opponent from up to three rooms away, but, as 
the distance increases, your accuracy will suffer. You only have a 
limited number of shots, so use them carefully. 

   To attempt to hit a player, use the command "shoot <player>". If he is 
in a room west of you, for example, the command "shoot <player> w" will 
allow you to snipe him. However, if you miss him, he will be alerted to 
your presence. 

   You will be eliminated after being hit twice, and will be transported 
back to the temple of Midgaard. If both players use up all shots, the 
match goes into sudden death, and each player has 99 shots. Level does 
not matter, immortals and newbies can play alike, although some skills 
will be beneficial, such as sneak, hide, and scout. Immortals of course, 
are forbidden to use potentially useful commands not available to 
mortals. The results of the match, as well as events such as a player 
getting wounded, are broadcast throughout the arena zone. 

   A spectators room is available for those who wish to yell encouragement,
taunts, and the like, as well as keep abreast of current wargame happenings. 
This room, which contains an arena board, is up and south from the Temple 
of Midgaard. 

   Enjoy!

BACKSTAB

Rogues only.

Backstab is a way to sneak up on a person and attempt to place your

BUILDER BUILDERS BUILDING

So you'd like to be a builder at Elite?  First you need an idea;
something interesting, exciting, unique, and well-planned.  Then you'll
have to follow through with that idea and turn it into reality.  We'd
like to have some of the most creative and original areas here at Elite,
and we'll need your help to do that.  Becoming a builder can be quite
rewarding, it's a great feeling to have people running through your
latest creation, wondering how someone could be insane enough to write
such a unique area!

Please note that building does not require #rany#N coding experience!

It's quite easy to learn, and we have a wide range of help files and
tools available to anyone who'd like to give it a shot.  Don't be
discourage if you've never built before.  Some of our best areas have
been created by first-time builders.

The first step you'll need to take on your way to becoming a builder is
submitting an area proposal.  This can be one of the most difficult
steps in a sometimes very long process.  You'll need to mail the
following information to #gGlob#N. (email or mudmail)

    1) The proposed name for your area
    2) Approximate number of rooms needed
    3) A description of the theme (or story) behind the area
    4) A sample room description
    5) A sample mob description
    6) A sample object description
    7) Any additional information that might be useful for helping to
       visualize your area
    
Your proposal will be reviewed by the current builders, and you should
receive a reply within 2 weeks from initial submission.  Don't be
discouraged if your original proposal is not accepted, with work that
idea could eventually turn into reality.

Once your proposal is accepted, you will receive a zone number (or
numbers if necessary) so you may begin work.  You will be allowed a
reasonable amount of time to build your area.  In cases where an area is
taking an unusually long time to be built, you may be contacted.
Because we are currently limited by the number of available zones, your
zone numbers may be reassigned if you do not respond.

Be aware that there are a few things that must be done before your area
is implemented:

    1) The area must be free of all grammar and spelling errors.
    2) The area must be playtested.
    3) All mobs and objects must be approved by the appropriate groups.
    4) A formal walkthrough must be completed.
    5) A map must be submitted (in text or image format).

If you have any questions regarding building, the best way to get
answers is to either contact one of the members of the World Group
(check the immlist for some names) or email Glob.

the clan requires from you is totally dependent on the rules of the

clan.  You must know the clan rules, and follow them.  If interested, 
please contact the immortal in charge of clans to start the application 
process.

            officers.

interclan relations, activity.  Also, current clans will be reviewed 
as needed.  Any clan which does not show improvement while on probation 
will be deleted.

#
"CLAN MOB"

The Clan Group is proud to announce a new addition to the list of 
ways your clan can spend, spend, spend here on Elite.  

  #CRestrictions#N

1. Mobs must be level 109 (immune to summon, charm)
2. Mobs must be sentinel.
3. Mobs will have stats comparable with guildmasters and other 
   shopkeepers
4. Mobs will have 0 exp assigned.
5. Mobs may be shopkeepers such as bartenders (Shopkeepers
   come with a free LAWFUL flag)
6. Mobs can not buy items
7. Mobs can not use the public channels
8. Mob actions can not be offensive.

Clans can buy a maximum of one (1) shopkeeper and three (3) other 
(non-shopkeeper) mobs.  No clan will be allowed more than a total of 
four (4) clan mobs.

  #CShopkeeper Standards#N

Shopkeepers for clans may not sell items at prices that are below 
the going price in town.  If bread is 10 gold at the Baker, clan 
shopkeepers can also sell bread for 10 gold.  Shopkeepers can not 
sell equipment of any kind.

They can sell a maximum of ten (10) items.  These may include 
original food or drink items, or potions, wands or scrolls sold 
in other shops around the Mud. All items are flagged for the 
particular clans use only.


  #CRequesting Clan Mobs#N

All requests should be sent to the Clan Group for review.  Once

        2. Actions (for mobs with actions)
        3. List of items sold and prices (for shopkeepers)
        4. Room the mob will load into
#
"CLAN SHOPKEEPER" "CLAN EQ"
This should not be confused with the shopkeeper in your clanhouse
selling potions, food and scrolls. The Clan Shopkeeper lives next
to the Clan Board in the Midgaard Library (swwnnnnne).

Clans may have up to 3 special clan items, which will be identical
in function to an existing piece of non-quest equipment. Members
of that clan will be able to EXCHANGE one of the regular items, for
its Clan Equivalent. The Exchange is free, but there is a one-off 
cost of 50 million to create the special clan item.

Example: Minions of Mokky create a Spider Shield, which is an
exact copy of a Large Round Shield, for 50mil. Any member of
Minions of Mokky can take a Large Round Shield to the Clan
Shopkeeper, and exchange it for a Spider Shield, which only other
members of their clan can use.

How to use: Go to the Clan Equipment Shopkeeper in the Library
and type "list". This shows a list of all your clans available
equipment, and the item you need to bring to exchange for it.
Drop the item on the ground, and type "exchange ##" where ## 
is the number of the exchange you want to make.

COLORS

In ELITE there is a color system implemented, which allows you to use 
colors in your titles/messages etc.

      Color for foreground shall be defined by
            ##<color-letter>, where letter is:

 #r##r - red        #b##b - blue      #y##y - yellow  #g##g - green
 #c##c - cyan       #m##m - magenta   #w##w - white   #W##W and #N##N - normal

 #R##R - dark red  #B##B - dark blue    #Y##Y - dark yellow #G##G - dark green
 #C##C - dark cyan #M##M - dark magenta #e##e - dark grey#N

     for ex: "##Ctest##rtest##N." looks as "#Ctest#rtest#N."

      Important: Do not forget ##N in end of colored text.

Colors for background are defined by
  ##:<color_letter>.

                      Examples:

 ##:r##y  - #:r#y yellow on red#N

 ##N returns background color to normal as well as foreground.


WARNING: on some terminals colors worked incorrectly so please be aware:
when using background colors your text can screw up terminals of other
players.

CircleMUD was developed from DikuMUD (Gamma 0.0) by Jeremy "Ras" Elson at
Johns Hopkins University's Department of Computer Science.  All code unique
to CircleMUD is protected under a copyright by the Trustees of the Johns
Hopkins University.

Many, many people contributed to CircleMUD in one way or another throughout
the course of its development.  Although it's impossible for me to remember
them all, I'd like to extend special thanks to certain people:

  -- Jeff Fink, for submitting a veritable mountain of excellent code.
  -- Chris Epler and Chris Herringshaw for extensive beta-testing and bug
     reporting.
  -- Furry (Alex Fletcher), for single-handedly managing Circle's world files.
  -- Fred Merkel, Ryan Watkins, Jay Levino, and Sharon Goza, for other
     code and area submissions.
  -- Jean-Jack Riethoven for porting the code to the Amiga, and David Carver
     for porting it to OS/2.
  -- Bill Bogstad and Tim Stearns for allowing Circle to exist at JHU.
  -- The DikuMUD folk, and the good old WhatMUD implementors Dave & Justin,
     for starting the ball rolling.
  -- Bryan Jolson, Steven Lacher, Cat Stanton, and Naved Surve, for being 
     there in the very early days of Circle's development.
  -- And, of course, Sharon, Ben, Erica, Aly, and Josh, for keeping me sane.

...plus everyone else in the Circle community who has submitted material!
Thanks everyone!

DRACONIAN

Draconians are the descendants of an ancient group of cursed dragons.
They were created from the offspring of these dragons to serve the forces
of evil, and most still do to this day.  They have the strength of
their dragon ancestors, and many have their intelligence, but because
each line of draconians evolved from a different kind of dragon there
is much variation.  Draconians are similar in appearance to lizardmen,
but they tend to have shorter tails or no tails at all.  They are
capable of speech, but they share the tell-tale hiss of lizardmen.
Draconians do not like to be compared to their lizardman cousins,
believing that they are far superior to them in all ways.  They dislike
humans end elves but has been known to associate with some of the more
evil races.

DROW DARKELF

dark smoky rooms to the sunny squares of Midgaard.  Drows are usually
shorter than elves, and have much less variation in coloring.  Most drows
have dark hair and dark eyes to match their dark souls.  Their eyesight
has evolved tremendously in their time under the surface to be perfect
for walking around caverns and caves without a light source, but they 
tend to have trouble on the surface because of the relative brightness.  
Drows are not well-liked by other races, but they don't seem to mind much 
since the feeling is mutual.

ETHICS

                      IMMORTAL CODE OF ETHICS

I.     Be fair.  This doesn't just mean to try to act fair.  It also 
       means avoiding situations in which your impartiality can be 
       compromised.  These situations can include enforcing policy where 
       clan members, friends, signifigant others or enemies are 
       concerned.  If this means waiting until another non-involved 
       immortal arrives, so be it.

       A.  Fairness is more important than justice.
       B.  If you are personally involved in a rules dispute, odds are 
           you can't be fair.  Get another immortal to adjudicate it.
       C.  Your immortal is a tool to be used to help the mud, not a 
           bonus to help your mortals or the mortals of others.  This 
           means you should avoid situations where your immortal gives 
           you an edge in zones.  If you write a zone, try to avoid 
           running it for items or experience until others get a chance.  
           If you are online, resist the urge to log on a mortal when you 
           see areas reset.

II.    Listen.  Don't assume things about mortals, and don't act like 
       they are stupid.  If they are talking to us, they have something 
       important to say.

III.   Understand.  Remember, a lot of things on a mud can make people
       angry.  Try to understand why a mortal feels the way he does.
       Put yourself in their shoes.

IV.   Be considerate.  Having an immortal gives you a lot of clout in
      discussions.  Use it, don't abuse it.  Always remember that you
      are an immortal and represent Elite, even when you are playing
      a mortal.

      A.  A special note on consideration.  Remember, many of our users
          speak english as their second language.  Be very courteous when
          dealing with these people, and try your best to understand what
          they are saying.  Sometimes this will mean asking another god 
          to help.
      B.  While there is nothing wrong with being invisible, try to be
          visible when actually punishing mortals.  If you have reason
          to be invisible, consider why;  you may have a conflict of
          interest (such as the mortal hates you) and in this case, it
          is better if you ask another immortal to help.

V.    Use common sense.  Don't get angry when dealing with mortals.  It
      only makes it worse.  If they are angry, let them blow off some
      steam first.  If you are angry, stop dealing with them problem and
      let someone else take care of it.  If people are unable to agree, 
      never underestimate the value of compromise -- even if one person
      is wrong.

VI.   Don't make a mistake because you're afraid to ask questions.  If 
      you don't know what to do, ask another immortal to help you.  Also, 
      if you need to make a ruling, be sure to gather the facts before 
      acting.  It's more important to answer the questions of "why" and 
      "how" than the question of "who", and all your rulings should have 
      a basis in fact, and not rhetoric or bias.

VII.  The immortals are a team.  The best way for us to work is through
      constructive work and constructive criticism.  If we have problems,
      they should be solved among the immortals -- including the mortals
      in our conflicts will only make them worse.

VIII. EliteMUD is a hobby for all of us, just as it is a hobby for the
      players.  All your actions should be guided by this concept;  this
      is not a job, it is a game.

FAIRY FAIRIES

Fairies are a magical race of woodland creatures that are believed to
be descendants of the spirits of the forest themselves.  They are tiny,
beautiful beings with gossamer wings and pointed ears.  Their hair
and eyes have the same variation in color as the forest itself.  Fairies
are weak because of their small size, but because they often live for
several hundred years they are usually very wise.  They are inherently
magical creatures, and are often protected from harm by the very forces
of nature that created them.  Fairy folk are playful and friendly, but
tend to stay close to the forests from which they come.  Fairies only
recently began to venture into Midgaard from the surrounding forests, so
not much is known about this mystical race.

FELINE

good and evil are of little concern to them, they will adapt to suit 
their needs.  They are humble creatures that do not boast of power or 
strength.  Their heightened senses, great agility, and quick wit are all 
they need to survive and prosper.

Gnomes are a race of good-natured creatures that originated in the
forests east of Midgaard.  They look much like dwarves, but are not
quite as stocky.  Gnomes generally have light colored hair and eyes
and a rosy complexion.  They are long-lived and sturdy folk.  Gnomes
are intelligent, but they tend to focus their attentions on unsolvable
problems.  Gnome scientists are common, but none ever seem to become
famous!

GROUP

Usage : GROUP [player]
        GROUP all

GROUP with no arguments shows the status of your group.  GROUP <player>
adds or removes <player> from your group.  GROUP ALL adds everyone who is
following you to your group.

If you are a group member, then you will share experience points for 
killing monsters equally among the group. Experience points will only be 
shared among group members that are in the same location, at the time of 
the killing blow. Sharing is regardless of wherther the group members 
have been participating in the fight.

To make a group, a "leader" must be selected. All members of the group
must then "follow" the leader using the follow command. The leader should
NOT follow anyone at all! The leader can now toggle group membership for
each player in the group, by using "group <player_name>". The leader
should remember to include himself in the group.

Example:

Quifael and Redferne wishes to group with Dragon.

Quifael : "follow dragon"
Redferne: "follow dragon"
(Dragon should be following no one but himself)
Dragon  : "group all"
(or if he wishes to make things mroe complicated)
Dragon  : "group dragon"
Dragon  : "group redferne"
Dragon  : "group quifael"

Later when Dragon get upset at Quifael (because he is sleeping all the 
time) he types : "Group Quifael" to kick Quifael out of the group.

The Guildhouse is the place where mortals may go to escape the troubles

cleric, mage), and this is where you can practice your skills and spells,
but only in the guild to which you belong.

#
HALF-ELF HALFELF

Half-elves are a hybrid of the human and elf races.  They are often 
shunned by both races, but consider themselves superior because of their 
elven lineage.  They are the same height as a typical human, though they 
tend to be a bit more slender.  Their coloration varies much more than 
that of humans and elves because of their hybrid nature.  They are 
normally as long-lived as elves and just as intelligent, but they tend to 
be a bit larger and more muscular thanks to their human half.  Because 
they share the qualities of both races, half-elves are able to learn many
skills and trades.
#
HALFLING HOBBIT

Halflings are a race of short peace-loving creatures.  They have an
appearance similar to that of elves, but they are considerably shorter.
Halflings are outgoing but not particularly brave.  Many races consider
halflings to be a lazy race, and they are usually right, but some young
halflings will go out of their way to seek out adventure.  Most halflings
never leave their village, choosing to stay in their comfortable woodland
homes.  Halflings tend to shun most of the larger races, preferring to
associate with elves and fairies.

Humans are a large race of creatures with adequate strength and
intelligence, enabling them to learn a variety of skills and trades.

achieving a great deal in their short lives.

LINK LINKLESS

A lot of players have problems with their links to the game.  This can be
very hazardous to your health in the middle of a battle, of course.

  I. If your link is broken, you will automatically attempt to flee each
     time someone attempts to hit you.  If you manage to flee, then you
     will be saved by divine forces, and put in a safe place until you
     reconnect to the game.

 II. If your link jams (freezes), you have a problem.  The only solution 
     we can give is that you break your link as quickly as possible.  By
     breaking the link you can hope that the above procedure is 
     initiated.

     Do not try to get out of a fight by breaking link.  You will be not
     reimbursed for any experience or equipment if you purposefully
     cut your link.

LIZARDMAN

Lizardmen are an ancient race of creatures that appear to have evolved
from more primitive lizards.  They are tall and strong with the head
and tail of a lizard.  Their scaly skin varies in color from green to
brown, and some isolated populations are capable of changing their skin
color to match their surroundings.  They have large green or yellow
eyes with three eyelids over each.  Though lizardmen are capable of
speech, their forked tongues cause them to hiss.  Lizardmen differ from
the primitive lizards with their humanoid appearance and higher 
reasoning.  The lizardmen tend to be solitary, avoiding civilization and 
even others of their own race.  Many lizardmen only willingly come in 
contact with others only for procreation, and some don't even do that!

MINOTAUR

Minotaurs are the descendants of a cursed beast that was half man and
half bull.  They are large and strong, but they are normally not very
intelligent.  The minotaurs that venture into Midgaard tend to get
into many fights because of their strong wills and violent natures.
Minotaurs usually have dark brown or black fur covering their heads and
backs.  They have a long tail and two sharp horns on their bull-like
heads, with the torso, legs and arms of a human.  Minotaurs have their
own code of honor: "The one still standing is the winner."  These fierce
creatures are intimidating and are often shunned by all other races due 
to their war-like nature.
#
MONK

PK KILLING PLAYER_KILLING

Player Killing (PK) is completely illegal except in the PK zone.  The PK
zone is, from the market square, 3w5swse.  Once inside the zone, you
*must* obey the following rules:

* All PK is by consent only.  This means you must preplan your fights.
  Once the fight ends, you must stop fighting, and in order to fight
  again, you must once more agree to the fight.  Also, the fight only
  begins when all contestents are ready.

* You are no longer a part of any PK if you leave the zone.  This means
  dying, being summoned out, walking out, and so on.  This includes
  leaving by accident.  In short, if you leave, stop fighting.

* There is no grouping in PK.

* If you wish to make terms before the fight (such as no potions, or
  no eq, or no circling, etc), you should get an outside party such
  as an immortal to observe the fight.  This ensures that all parties
  obey the rules.  Breaking agreed-upon terms is the same thing as
  breaking official PK rules.

* Violators of these rules will be crushed.  Happy PKing!

#
"POLICY CHANNELS"

EliteMUD Policy - CHANNELS - Correct usage of Public Channels

There are a lot of different communication channels available for
different purposes and it should not be that difficult to follow
them.  No advertising other muds on any channel, folks.

1. #CGRAT#N channel:   This is the ONLY channel where messages
   regarding level gains and congratulations thereof belong. Keep
   those here.

2. #GCHAT#N channel:   This is a communications channel meant for
   mud-related topics that may be of interest to the entire mud.

3. #YGOSSIP#N channel:   This is a general communication channel,
   it is meant for funny, serious, or any other kind of messages that
   are not mud-related.  This is also the only channel where you can
   use your colourful language and swear, as long as you are not
   harassing any other player.

4. #RYELL#N channel:   Yell sends your message to everyone in the same
   zone as you.

5. #mQUEST#N channel:   This channel exists solely for information
   to be exchanged during quests, and should be turned off when
   quest is over. It should go without saying, anything talked about
   on it should be quest related.

6. #wNEWBIE#N channel:   This channel is for newer players to request
   help, and for more experienced players to assist them.

7. #MAUCTION#N channel:   This is a communications channel meant for
   the selling, bidding and purchase of items.

8. #rPK-SAY#N channel:   This is a communications channel meant for
   PK-related topics that may be of interest.
        #r
Please note the the only channel where any language other than ENGLISH
is acceptable is #YGOSSIP#r!#N
#
"POLICY LANGUAGE"

EliteMUD Policy - LANGUAGE - Acceptable Language Guidelines

With the exception of the gossip channel, swearing on public channels
should be only mild at worst. This is the type of language that you
might hear in a PG rated film.

This mud has always had a policy of keeping all public channels except
gossip as "family rated". There is absolutely no way to "prescribe" what
what can and cannot be said - at least we couldn't think of a way. So we 
checked out the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) to see how 
-they- decide what is acceptable:
    #C
Many people are offended, some of them deeply, by bad language, including
the use of expletives with a religious association. The extent of that
offence varies according to age, background and beliefs. Different groups
(for example, a minority ethnic community) have their own, seperate
standards of acceptability. Additionally, the severity of any particular
word or expression will depend upon the context within which it is used.

For these reasons, it is impossible to set out comprehensive list of
acceptable words or expressions which will satisfy all sections of the
public. The advice at different classification levels, therefore, provides
general guidance with reference to specific terms only where there is a
reasonable consensus of opinion.#N

So, there you have it....THEY cant decide either. They use their judgement,
and offer the following guidelines. They suggest swearing be classified in
the following broad bands: #wHELP POLICY CLASSIFICATION#N
#
"POLICY CLASSIFICATION"

EliteMUD Policy - CLASSIFICATION - Language Classification 

The BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) suggest swearing be 
classified in the following broad bands:
   #Y
 Very Mild#N:  Damn, Hell, god, bloody, son-of-a-bitch, sod, tart, crap#Y
      Mild#N:  Bugger, screw, arse, slag, slut, tosser, Jesus Christ, 
             dickhead, bitch, shit#Y
  Moderate#N:  Piss off, whore, arsehole, prick, bollocks, twat, bastard, 
             wanker, shag#Y
    Strong#N:  Fuck#Y
Very Strong#N: Motherfucker, cunt


To be honest, we were a little surprised at some of the words rated as 
"moderate" (they were strong when Mokky was a regular user). Regardless 
we think they are a pretty good basis for determining acceptable language.

Aside from gossip, swearing should be kept at #RMILD#N or less (which is  
equivalent to that heard in a PG film). We are sorry that we can't put 
that in context for those of you from countries other than the UK.

Those words which constitute #MModerate#N swearing, should result in a polite  
request to move the conversation to gossip. Stronger language may or may  
not warrant a warning depending on context, and depending on whether the 
player is a newbie, or if they have perhaps used chat instead of ct by   
mistake. #rIn all cases, if the swearing is blatant or persistent, punishment 
will be forthcoming.#N
#
"POLICY REIMB"

EliteMUD Policy - REIMB - Reimbursement

These rules are not set in stone, but in general they will be followed.

  i) Money and experience will not be reimbursed.  Use of the Elite's
     ATM system will prevent major money loss, and Elite's periodic
     saving of the player file will prevent major loss of experience.

 ii) In general, only equipment that was in use will be reimbursed.

iii) Eq gained in a multiple crash situation will not be reimbed:
        "The Mud giveth and the Mud taketh away".

 iv) The reimbursement of quest or special eq, being that it is rare
     in nature may need to be approved by a 115 Immortal or the Quest
     group leader.

  v) The mud has a sweeper. It will clean up any item on the ground
     every time a zone resets. Only clan houses and Godrooms are 
     immune to this. One other room immune to this is the Midgaard
     Chat Room (ws of Temple). If items are lost due to the sweeper
     they will NOT be reimbursed.

 vi) There is a 100 item limit on what you may have on your character.
     If you go over this limit and lose items due to logging out or a
     mud crash, it will not be reimbursed.

QUEST

Quests are immortal-run special events. There is no set format for
quests, although in general they involve some amount of role-playing,
problem solving or combat against unusual opponents. The best way
to join in a quest is to interact with mobs who appear to be talking
with players - then follow hints and instructions. Sometimes quests
will be announced in advance on the Quest Board in the library
(swwnnnw).

Very often, as a reward for successful participation in a quest you
will be awarded Quest Points. These will show in a separate line
in your score. When you have enough points, you can use them to
purchase special quest items from the quest shopkeeper in the library.

#
RATMAN

Ratmen are the creation of a cruel god that made common sewer rats larger
and smarter.  Though they are infinitely more intelligent than their
primitive ancestors, ratmen are still prone to rummaging through garbage.
They are usually covered with thick brown or black fur and have beady
black eyes and a large pink tail.  Some ratmen have white hair and pink
eyes, but this rare breed is nearly extinct due to their participation in
extensive experimentation done by local alchemists.  Ratmen are cunning
and sly, and very capable of complex reasoning, but they tend to prefer
trades that allow them to live off of the prosperity of others.

#
REMORT

A remort is a mortal character, that is, in most cases, more powerful
than your average mortal.  Being a remort allows you to choose any
class combination you want, assuming you follow the simply rules.
The main benefit is that you are now able to make class combinations
that are not available to you when you make a new character.
There are no exceptions, and all remorts will be done according to
the rules as they are posted here.  Any questions that you might have
may be directed at a member of the Remort Team.

For more info on certain topics, type the following:
                HELP REMORT <TOPIC>

Choose one of the following topics:
        READY         CLASS      SECOND         FOURTH
        RACE          FIRST      THIRD          TRI

Thanks to Phobos, Phish and Fitzroy for source of REMORT related topics.

#
"REMORT READY"

Here are some questions to ask yourself before you ask to be
remorted. Doing this will save you some time in the Remort Lab.

* Are you 109 in all of your classes?  If not, go level.

* Is all of your gold in the bank?  If not, put it in or you will
lose it upon remorting.

* Are you carrying any objects?  If you are, be sure that they are
usable by a level 1 character.  If they are not, you must either put
them in a locker or give them to another character.  If they are,
you may keep them with you while being remorted.  Just as a reminder,
you will be asked to remove and drop everything you have on you.

* For first remorts, do you know which race you want to be?  If not,
you should make a decision.

* Do you know what class you want to be, and are you sure that you
are allowed to be that class?

#
"REMORT RACE"
On your first remort, you must select a race.  You may choose any
race you want, except for god, avatar, dragon, demon, werewolf,
feline, or vampire.  The ONLY way you can be one of these races is
if you already are one before you remort.

After you select your race for your first remort, you are stuck
with that race until you reach your fourth remort.  Choose wisely,
there will be no leniency in changing races after they have been
set to you.

On your fourth remort, you can become an avatar if you wish.  You
get all of your stats maxed to 23.  Naturally, if you do not want
to be an avatar, you do not have to be.  For example, if you are a
dragon, you are free to keep dragon as your race if you wish.  You
would still get your stats maxed in any case.

#
"REMORT CLASS"
There are four basic archtypes, warrior, cleric, thief and
magic user.  Each of these archtypes are the base for three
special classes.  If you type 'help class' you will see a
list of all of the classes offered on Elite.

The archtype classes are listed in the first column.  The
special classes associated with each archtype are in the
same row as the archtype they are based on.  For example,
the special types that are derrived from a warrior are
knight, ranger, and cavalier.

See also CLASS

#
"REMORT FIRST"

Anyone who is level 109 in all of their classes and is not a
remort may ask to become a first remort.  When you become a
first remort, you are put back at level one, with new classes
and a new race and start all over again.

Your race choices are outlined in the post marked RACES.  The
way your class choice works is this:   First, you pick whatever
class you are now.  If you are a multi-class, you must pick one
of your classes.  If the class that you have chosen is a special
class (ie, anything but a wa/th/cl/mu), you downgrade it to it's
archtype (Kn -> Wa, Mo -> Cl, etc...).  Next, you add another
archtype, and are now a dual class character.  Then, you pick one
of your two classes and upgrade it to a special class.

For example:  John the 109 th/cl picks cleric as his class.  Then
he adds warrior to it.  This now makes him a wa/cl.  He upgrades
the warrior to a ranger and John becomes a level 1, Ra/Cl.  This
seems fairly simple, if there are any questions, ask a remort god.

#
"REMORT SECOND"

In order to become a second remort, you must be a first remort that
is level 109 in all of your classes.  However, the rules now change
a little bit.

You may not pick a new race.  As you were told when you remorted for
the first time, you are stuck with that race until your fourth remort.

This time around, instead of picking one of your classes going through
the procedure for a first remort, you simply upgrade your remaining
archtype to a special type.

For example.  John, our level 109/109 Ra/Cl wishes to second remort.
He chooses druid as his second class.  He then becomes John, the
level 1 Ra/Dr.  And off to level he goes.

#
"REMORT THIRD"

To become a third remort, you must be a second remort who is level
109 in all of your classes.  Again, the rules are slightly
different from those of previous remorts.

This time around, you keep the two archtypes that you have from
your second remort, and add a third class.  You may add any of the
four archtypes.  As with second remorts, you are not allowed to
change your race.

For example, John, our level 109/109 Ra/Dr wants to third remort.
He chooses to add thief as a new class, and he then becomes
John, the level 1 Ra/Dr/Th.

#
"REMORT FOURTH"

In order to become a fourth remort, you must be a third remort
who is level 109 in all of your classes.  Unlike previous
remorts, you have a few more options this time around.

Race -- You may choose to become an avatar this time around.
Avatars are the best race that is still available to mortals.
If you do not want to be an avatar, that is your choice.  If
you are a quest race, you may keep that race.  If you are not
a quest race, and do not wish to become an avatar, you may pick
any other race you wish.

Hunger & Thirst --  You have the option of having hunger and
thirst toggled off.  If you do not want hunger and thirst off,
it is your responsibility to say so.  Vampires may not have
their blood turned off, being that they are required to role
play the vampire to remain powerful.

Maxed Stats -- No matter what race you choose on your fourth
remort, you are allowed to have your stats maxed if you wish.
If for some reason you do not want your stats maxed, it is your
responsibility to say so.

Class -- You may pick any class combination on your fourth
remort, be it a single, dual, or tri class structure.  You are
not limited to your previous classes in any way.

For example, John, our level 109/109/109 Ra/Dr/Th wants to
fourth remort.  He decides to become an avatar race and wants
to be a Ca/Wi/Cl.  However silly this may seem it is a valid
choice and he then becomes John, the level 1 Ca/Wi/Cl.  He
gets all of his stats maxed and his hunger and thirst toggled
off.

Note:  You will be charged 10M gold for each time you remort
       after your 4th.  

#
"REMORT TRI"

Because of the TRI clan, we have a special set of rules for people
who desire to remain TRI class characters for all of their remorts.

First Remort:  Instead of the rules stated, he keeps his three
classes (wa/cl/mu or wa/th/mu) and is allowed to change any one of
them to a special class.

Second Remort:  Instead of the rules stated, he keeps his first
remort race, and has the OPTION to change one of his archtypes to
any other archtype.  Sorry, Your special class has to remain the
same.

Third Remort:  Instead of the rules stated, he keeps his second
remort class and upgrades one of his archtypes to a special class.

Fourth Remort:  You may choose any class combination that you wish.

All of the rules that do not pertain to class selection are the
same for TRI remorts as with all others, ie, races, hunger/thirst,
maxing stats...

SHOPS

Shops are places where the adventurer may purchase equipment for his 
quests, and where he may sell his treasure if he should manage to survive 
the perils with his life and sanity intact. Many shops trade only in a 
specific type of merchandise. Thus, a baker may well refuse to buy your 
armor, even if it is of high quality!
   To some people, the prospect of obtaining the entire inventory of a 
shop by murdering the keeper may appear tempting - but beware: The 
shopkeepers are often rugged, capable men; roughened by years of trading 
and, indeed, surviving in a world where the only safe prospect is death 
in the end.

> list       - Will display the items for sale

SWEEPER

Every day, the mud loads about thirty thousand objects. If they
were just left lying around, then very quickly the mud would be
full of junk.

To prevent this, when a zone resets, a SWEEPER goes through each
room in the zone, and clears away any discarded objects. This is
why it is dangerous to leave objects lying around on the ground - 
they might get cleared up by mistake!

To avoid losing items, NEVER drop them in game zones. The only safe

room in Midgaard.

TROLL

Trolls are ugly, strong, and dumb.  They love to fight with almost
anything that moves, and even things that don't move!  Trolls have been
known to attack even a dead foe.  Their stout bodies can take a lot
of abuse with little wear and tear, and it sure is hard for them to get
any uglier.  Trolls vary in appearance, but most tend to have dark hair
and eyes with putrid skin and teeth.  They don't normally smell very
good, a result of their taste for raw flesh.  Trolls are not the smartest
creatures, but they sure know how to fight.

VAMPIRE
                             #mVAMPIRE#W

When a human's mortal blood is tainted by that of the undead, a vampire 
is born. These abominations of nature have the potential to be more 
powerful in every respect than a human ever could possibly imagine.  A 
vampire can incorporate the characteristics of a bat into thier bodies 
and take flight.  Also, these defilers of God's life cycle no longer 
require normal sustinance; instead they feed on the blood of their 
victims.  This act causes thier strength to grow, but the longer they 
roam without feeding the weaker they become, ensuring that their hunger 
rules their unlives eternally.

The level minimum for joining the vampire quest race is 50, or remort
status.  Your writing ability, role playing talent, and mud knowledge 
will be tested.

WEREWOLF

When the full moon rises, the werewolves prowl the streets of Midgaard.
Proud warriors able to assume the form of the wolf, these deadly 
predators battle between their own inner rage and a world that calls them 
monsters.

Defenders of nature from mankind, these creatures are known for their
inherent goodness.  Despite this, some are consumed by their rage and 
turn to evil.  These deadly beings are feared the most of all.

Contrary to mythology, werewolves are born, not made, and no-one knows
they are a were until the changes begin to occur.  Certainly, some people
may feel out of place or different from others;  they tend to be broody
and solitary, but it's not until their first rage takes them that they
know the truth.  This is often the hardest time for the new werewolf, for
they must reconcile their new, dangerous selves with their lives. 

Werewolves are the creatures born to prey on mortal men.  For this 
reason, they are dangerous, and driven by their hunger.

Chani is currently in charge of the werewolf race.

Note that you cannot abbreviate the worship command.  If you do it'll be
considered as the worship social. (worshi)  Worship will give your deity 
or hero more power, thereby showing how popular he/she/it is.  The person 
will naturally be more helpful towards their worshippers.

Also note that only long term worshipping, ie not change deities often, 
will affect the worshipped.  Sporadically changing deity does nothing.  
There is also a PENALTY for changing deities.  You LOSE all your current 
EXPERIENCE.  This do not apply when you first start to worship someone.  

You can check whom you are worshipping in the SCORE list.
