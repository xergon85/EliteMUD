                 edit, writing or removal of messages is possible.
               - Added EDIT message command for boards . Edit works so that LEVEL_IMPL
                 can edit any message. REMOVE_LVL on clanboard will allow for editing of all
                 messages. Messages can be edited by self. 
               - Added LOCK message command for boards. Lock allows you to lock a message 
                 from being removed or edited until unlocked. For general boards, LEVEL_ADMIN
                 can use and for clanboards REMOVE_LVL. Lock board will add the BOARD_LOCKED
                 flag to the board.
               - Added UNLOCK message command for boards. Reverse effect of LOCK. Unlock board
                 will remove the BOARD_LOCKED flag from the board.

                 unlock_msg(), lock_board(), unlock_board(),msg_locked().

               - Added struct message_flag, set_msg_flag(), unlock_msg(),Board_display_msg(),
                 Board_amend_msg(), Board_lock_msg() uses it.

                 fighting you if you flee. Should solve the circle/bash after

handler.c      - In unequip_char commented out HMV update (to lock down to max HMV)

                 replacement item has. Suggested by Goozer.


08/01/03 13:50 - Bod

                 is equal to or less than max_remort_level
handler.c      - In affect_total changed EQ affect_modify check not to remove
                 obj->bitvector (remove and re-add) - fixes temp glitch

act.wizard.c   - Added extern char *item_affects[];
               - Rewrote do_stat_character Affected By section to incorporate
                 SPELL_FROM_ITEM displays Magic: (from item) regeneration
                 for example (Error messages are set to show on affects which

handler.c      - In equip_char and unequip_char modified call to affect_modify
                 to not pass bitvector information and instead run a check to 
                 add / remove bitvector through affect_char (ie Affected By(2)
                 - spell / skill affects) - won't set if affect is already on 
                 char - is distinguished as type SPELL_FROM_ITEM to allow 
                 proper handling of bitvector removal with item removal etc

constants.c    - Changed version to 6.3.129j
fight.c        - Modified raw_kill so PKOK players never leave a corpse (am thinking of
                 changing this so that they leave a corpse but nothing is placed in it -
                 this would allow creation of PK items that are left in corpse for victor
                 to take - ie items like for example pk crown etc)
graph.c        - Changed so a PKOK char CANNOT track another PKOK character.

               - Added skill check for PIERCE on pierce_no_backstab (type 12) for skillbonus
magic.c        - Duplicated ITEM_WEAPON checks for ITEM_FIREWEAPON so bows can be seperated
                 onto a seperate item type for future changes - requested by Mokky

actoffensive.c - Rewrote pkok_check to work with PKOK system and pk_regardless 
act.wizard.c   - Added set pkok (pkok flag) for IMM_PK and IMM_ADMIN (Rahl and Israfel

                  (GET_LEVEL(ch) == LEVEL_DEITY)  ? "#m" :(\
                  (GET_LEVEL(ch) == LEVEL_RETIRED) ? "#e" :(\

act.comm.c     - Changed mute so muted players can see channel history but still not 
                 use channels - requested by Dismal
act.informative.c - Added [-k clanvnum] to display on who -? as suggested by Euximus
act.offensive.c - Fixed do_kick so a failed kick no longer sends miss message and then
                 performs a succesful kick - Found by Drusian
act.wizard.c   - In do_config fixed max_bank_gold xxM display to show properly
                 - reported by Mokky
                 In view_immortals and view_questors fixed Switched: displaying imm's
                 name instead of the mob they are switched into
utils.h        - Changed WAIT_STATE from = (cycle) to
                 #define WAIT_STATE(ch, cycle) { \
                    if ((ch)->desc) (ch)->desc->wait += (cycle); \
                    else if (IS_NPC(ch)) GET_MOB_WAIT(ch) += (cycle); }
                 suggested by Drusian
                 Fixes issue of circling (getting a wait state of 2) being bashed by a
                 mob like elite guards (in same round) and having wait state set to 1
                 and then being able to circle in 1 round stime instead of 2.
                 This way it just increments the wait state so a player being multi 
                 bashed by a group of mobs may not be able to action any commands until
                 they auto flee and likewise its possible for a group of players spam
                 bashing a mob to keep that mob sitting down (this is harder to do than
                 the mobs keep a player from using skills / spells - mob wait state works
                 in attacks whereas players work in combat rounds)

                 their position set to STUNNED (tick update will restore hitpoints and
                 put them back to POS_STANDING or heal)
                 If a player ends combat BELOW 0 hp then they are left to be healed,
                 first aided or die with tick update(s)
                 - Topic for debate - should having less than the required hp to be 
                 removed at end of combat set player to POS_INCAPACITATED and -3 hp
                 to require intervention from another player to keep them alive and

                 memory in editor not just parse memory to editor!


01/10/02 16:55 - Bod

constants.c    - Version changed to reflect the new month
fight.c        - In void damage added TO_NOTVICT msges for AMA - into oblivion and misses
                 fight msges - reported by Titan


23/09/02 13:40 - Bod

objsave.c      - Replaced all occurances of obj_to_obj in Crash_load_room 
                 with the 3 lines of obj_to_obj that move the objs about
                 thus preventing weight addition to containers in clan don rooms on boot
                 This will need to be changed in the future - original method was correct
                 but needed to work on a temporary copy of the objects to prevent affects
                 being applied to ingame copies


23/09/02 10:00 - Bod

act.wizard.c   - Removed Stats (Str, Dex etc) from view players and tidied so

objsave.c      - In Crash_crashsave_room removed Crash_clear_weight(world[roomnr]->contents);
                 This was causing items in clan don rooms to reduce contained weight every
                 Crash_save_all tick (wrapping containers to -ve contained weight). Issue is
                 now to find another way to resolve addition of contained weight to these 
                 objects on game boot.


21/08/02 07:55 - Bod

                 on various search criteria)

                 Added setting of obj->worn_on in equip_char (for extract_obj)

                 Would require use of AFF2 as AFF is full


23/05/02 06:00 - Bod

act.comm.c     - Changed yell to be disabled by NOGOSS as opposed to NOCHAT
                 Suggested by Titan to group "vulgar" channels together

                 to a player that this is a hidden item (ie no (hidden) appearing
                 by it when in inventory etc) - Also no removing of hidden flag on

                    the extra descrip of the mob and then be blinded (with no msg)
                    routine returns before providing details on health and equip

                 switched imms in online / offline and inherits their prefs.
                 Note if a switched imm is writing or mailing they will display

12/02/02 11:40 - Bod

interpreter.c  - LEVEL_IMMORT+ can now use imm commands while switched
                 Imm commands take affect from the imm body NOT the mob
                 Known issue with stat - displays mob stats not self
                 Other issues with use of immortal commands may wish to
